So they took us in a loop which in my opinion has the same attitude of pirates! we had to chase them down for 2 month till finally eDreams admitted their mistake and agreed to refund the money. After 2 weeks we got the money missing almost 30%, and when we asked why? they said 30% service charge!!! what kind of service is that? We have been forced on the gate not to board the flight, we ran in the airport right and left and still missed the flight, we have been charged after the app failed to make the booking right, we have been fighting and chasing them to get the money back, so how come you could justify the service fees?\\n\\nWhen I asked them to act responsible for their system failure, they acted arrogant that we are very proud of our operator and sorry  we won\\'t refund the balance.\\n\\nAnyway, I just wanted to share the story with everyone to take care, and my advice after this experience book your flight direct from the airlines, and use dreams just for exploring the options, but never give your credit card detail nor do a booking on their system.\\nTelephone inquiries were answered in the most informed and courteous way\\r\\n\\r\\nMy plants arrived in beautiful, healthy condition and in a timely manner.\\nBeautiful arrangement was delivered on time. You can\\'t ask for more than that.\\nLooking for a job as a new grad is always hard, even with my home health experience.

I spoke with a friendly and professional service representative, called my contact at AAA, who arranged the trip, to have her send the necessary paperwork and then forwarded her e-mail to Allianz.  I checked online for the status of our claim periodically and received the appropriate coverage check within the promised time limit.  I was pleased with your service and would use your company in the future to protect my trip investment.\\nThe product came in on time. \\nI have not installed the hair as of yet.\\none of the only places I know where you can buy old consoles, old games and old accessories!\\nFast delivery\\nIt was easy and fast to book a last minute flight\\nReally was quick!\\nI was skeptical on using a car service I never used before, especially coming out of JFK. After pressing the notification button letting my driver know that he was minutes away, I was nervous not knowing if he would be there or having to wait a long period of time.

Would highly recommend for anyone struggling to find length in any garment.\\nCould not be more shocked, mad or disappointed with first and last experience of Vestiaire. Item not as sold. Vestiaire\\'s so called curation is nothing. They refuse to resolve issue. Call centre person rude and clearly doesn\\'t have even a modicum of intelligence - repeating the same unhelpful sentence, she completely misunderstands the concept of customer service. No response to complaints. This company is unprofessional and not at all oriented to providing the service they claim to offer. I would like to warn other consumers to stay away unless they wish to waste their money / increase the stress level in their lives. I should have checked this website before purchasing from Vestiare, am clearly not the only one to have had a terrible experience.\\nThis was my first time ordering from your company and might possibly be my last.  The saving grace is that the cards arrived in a timely manner and OK.  Tried on line.  didn\\'t work.  called in and someone walked me through it.  I wanted a customized verse.  I requested writing on front of card in silver and inside verse in red.  When the front turned to red also, I was assured that notes were made and the correction would be made.  When I received the proof to approve, the verse was so small one couldn\\'t read it to tell if it was correct or not...it looked like a postage stamp on a field of white..  Called told it would be corrected...it wasn\\'t when I received another request to approve.  2-3 weeks later FINALLY got some one (I think it was Brandy) who finally got it right, increased the font size on the verse and who took the time to explain that in order to have the name on the outside of the card in a different color from the verse it was an additional $100 plus dollars...Fine, just don\\'t know why that wasn\\'t told to me by the first 3-4 people I spoke with and why the writing in the verse was ever made so small.  The cards look great now\\nNot enough check in staff so flight left half an hour late - was kept queuing for an hour.

Didn\\'t get all of the hardware that should come with it.\\nMy dress had damaged hook. They had no other dress in this style. Your company made me pay for shipping back.

Thank you!\\n+  everything as discribed,  100% satisfied\\r\\n\\r\\n- I did not recieve a password after booking, so it was not possible to tell the hotel some special preferences. I had to call the hotel for that, which worked fine.\\nChanging our registration system over to LeagueApps has been a great experience. Not just because the software is great (it is)...most of all because of the tremendous support the company offers. Stephanie was available to answer questions whenever I needed help.

It is very easily confused with the search entry, in Google, of : AIRPORT PARKING JFK.\\nI typed in airport parking at JFK and many parking facilities near JFK airport in New York popped up on my screen; but yours was not shown.\\nI then phoned your representative who told me that I must type in airportparkinginc. Then. I did locate you on the internet.\\nI am sure you lose many customers this way.\\nI don\\'t know how to fairly rate your business yet because I start parking at your JFK facility on August 28,2017.\\nServiz was very responsive to my request for a quote, made themselves available on short notice. They booked the job on the best day for me.  The floors have never looked better, Andrew did a great job.\\nSuper simple and easy process to book a flight!\\nThe process was simple and quick. Jackie was friendly and knowledgeable she made it a positive experience\\nI am a committed bike commuter. Preparing to buy a house in north Seattle, but working on capitol hill, I have hills both ways, about a 7 mile commute, and have spent too many mornings and evenings mopping sweat as I arrive to work and back home, particularly on warmer days (>50 degrees does it for me!).  I am cruising up the hills with guilt-inducing speed, MUCH cooler, and still get a good workout. Cycling on the flats at my usual cruising speed ~20 mph is beyond the e-assist speed, but this feels fine. My road bike is notably heavier and handles a little differently with the additional weight in the front, but it\\'s small and I will learn quickly. I have been a little surprised to find that there is a barely perceptible drag when I am cruising... it\\'s not the additional weight. It MIGHT be the transition from e-assist to my own power. I worry that it is something electrical intrinsic to an electric motor. If I didn\\'t have the big hills, and were out for a mostly flat cruise, I would be tempted to switch out to my old front wheel. If I had my kiddos in the bike trailer, I would definitely stick with the Hill-topper wheel (AKA wind-stopper AKA tot-hauler). I got great service from the staff and enjoyed talking to them when I picked up my wheel at their warehouse space in SODO.\\nThe mini calendars are so cute.  I love to give them as gifts.\\r\\nThe address labels are great, anytime I need any labels, I\\r\\ngo to Walter Drake.\\n(see title for details)\\nEasy enough way to move large packages and luggage!\\n3 weeks after buying from Buydig I\\'ve got no merchandise and no refund.  Their idiotic shipping policies, which they tried to blame on FedEx, that refused to allow FedEx to resend or allow me to pick up myself.  This resulted in it eventually being returned for basically no reason other then Buydig not wanting me to actually receive the on sale TV.  Their policy is that when a thing is returned you have to re-buy it, of course the return process takes so long that by the time you eventually get your money back, I still haven\\'t after 3 or so weeks, the sale is off and you now have to pay normal price. \\n\\nOn top of that their Customer service is horrible and extremely uninterested in actually helping you.  They only respond once a day and are only capable of a few responses that are unhelpful in the extreme and aggravating at best.\\nFeel great because finally i can top up my google play account and get what i wish to for long times ago! Thanks so much!!\\nI have purchased several watches from these guys and there has never been a hitch.Great product, great prices, Great service.\\r\\nGeoffrey\\r\\nNew Zealand\\nI had a great experience dealing with Flashbay.

I was in a pinch and in need of a place to stay and had no issues getting a hotel on the fly!\\nI had an appointment recently for an extraction and a Temporary Bridge. I was received with warm Smiles from the Staff. The atmosphere is very relaxing and calm. Dr. Annette Murphy kept me informed through out the process. The whole process was so comfortable that I lost track of time as I was using the Virtual Movie Glasses.  University Oak Dental is the Best in Town. I recommend that you come to University Oaks Dental. You will Love it.\\nI\\'ve had an absolutely horrible experience with trustedhousesitter. It was bad enough to receive a review based on blatant falsehoods it\\'s another to have to deal with an unsupportive and indifferent customer support team. Carla, the support representative did little to mollify a bad situation. I felt like I wasn\\'t listened to, or that I was met with any degree of empathy.\\nThere is absolutely no 24/7 support! My numerous phone calls went to voice mail. My attempts to live chat was met with an automated response. Just a chain of back and forth emails.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a homeowner and a serious situation arises like someone trashing your home or not properly caring for your pet, or if you\\'re a sitter and the homeowner tells blatant lies about you, you\\'ll have no recourse. I\\'m sure in a perfect world house sitting is a great win/win situation. But in the real world things aren\\'t perfect. And my experience is that Trustedhousesitter is ill-equipped to deal with these events.\\n\\nMark Ruggieri \\nCalifornia, USA\\nFrom checkout to my door everything went smoothly and arrived quickly.Great quality merchandise.\\nWhy the amount is R2000 while you say it R850 can you elaborates about the additional of R1273 for full cover\\nExcellent personalize customer service.

They held my purchase to ransom until I gave them my phone number in order to receive a pin code which then unlocked my game. Otherwise it suggested it would be cancelled and no indication was given if I would get my money back.\\nBooking our tour up the Eiffel Tower with Fat Tire Bike Tours was super easy online.

Again thank you. I’m happy to be a member. Sincerely Sheila Marie Nicley.....Don’t ever give up😊\\neasy and quick. got in and got it done............\\nreally good service\\nI was recommended to this parking service and planned to use it on my next trip.  I told another friend who was traveling  about this service based on my other friend\\'s experience.  They used Global and raved about the service.  I went ahead and booked my reservation for my own trip coming up.\\r\\nEast, quick and simple.\\r\\nThank you Global Airport Parking!\\nThe only real issue we had was with the lock installation.  We had Schlage brand deadbolt locks and the installer put in an electric deadbolt lock on our front door and used a Kwikset lock unit.  That left us having to use two different keys for our house.  The door unit the installer put in would not accept a Schlage cylinder so we had to have 2 new Kwikset deadbolt installed in place of the Schlage cylinders.  The installer never mentioned it.\\n\\nThe only other comment I might make is that there is no \"owners manual\" to go along with the system that would explain the system panel, battery replacement, etc.\\nA shake of Myoplex once a day helps me keep my weight at about 107 which is good for my height. I need the protein for my bone density. to me it is a win win deal.\\r\\nCaroline Westcott\\nI love the design that I bought, the sweater was much thinner than I thought it would be and is more of \"spring\" weight rather than a winter sweater. Nice design, slightly overpriced, quick shipping. I would buy this again but I wash that they mentioned this is not a high quality sweater to begin with.\\nThe pre-filled master and slave for the clutch was great. It arrived in good time and was exactly what we ordered.\\nIf I could give a zero star (or, better yet... a MINUS rating) for Avas Flowers, I would!   \\n\\nMy cousin passed away and my family and I were unable to attend the out-of-state funeral.   In our stead, I wanted to order sympathy plants for his mother and widow, as well as flowers for the service.  \\n\\nI\\'ve ordered flowers many, MANY times before (usually with a different online floral service), but have NEVER had as upsetting, maddening or exasperating experience in my life!   In brief (yes - this is the SHORT version):\\n\\n* I called Ava\\'s Flowers on Saturday to order flowers and plants for my cousin\\'s funeral to be held Monday morning at 10:30 a.m.\\n\\n*  Guy #1 (who answered Saturday\\'s call) told me to call back on Sunday.  (???)\\n\\n* I called on Sunday and spoke with \\'Guy #2\\'.   I stressed that it was imperative that the plants/flowers were to be at the funeral home by/before 10 a.m. on Monday.\\n\\n*  Guy #2 put me on hold and claimed to be \"checking with the local florist\".  He then assured me that \"the local florist said they would open \\'extra early\\' on Monday to get the order ready and it is guaranteed to be at the funeral home before 10 a.m.\"\\n\\n* I reiterated that if there was ANY chance that the order wouldn\\'t be delivered in time for the funeral at 10:30 a.m. on Monday, then I didn\\'t want to place the order.  \\n\\n* Guy #2 GUARANTEED me that the order would arrive Monday morning  by/before 10 a.m. \\n\\n* I placed an order for two plants and one floral arrangement to be delivered to the funeral home Monday morning by/before 10 a.m.\\nThe total cost came to $208.18\\n\\n* Monday morning, I called the funeral home at 10 a.m. and asked if my flowers/plants had arrived.  They had not.\\n\\n* I went to my order confirmation e-mail and clicked on the \\'check delivery status\\' button.  A message came up that said my order was scheduled for delivery that day - and no other information was available at that time.\\n\\n* I called the phone number listed on my e-mail and went through a ridiculously long menu in an attempt to talk with a human.\\n\\n* Once I finally reached someone (a woman this time... I\\'ll call \\'Gal #1\\'),  I was asked to hold while they tried to contact the florist (I thought I was supposed to be talking with the florist in the first place)!   They couldn\\'t reach the florist - and then the line went dead.\\n\\n*  By this time, the funeral had already begun.   My phone rang and it was the same company, but this time I was speaking with a different woman who I\\'ll refer to as \\'Gal #2\\'.  In my frustration, I said I wanted to cancel the flowers (which, obviously, were not present at the funeral)... but still wanted the plants to go to the deceased\\'s mother and widow.  \\n\\n* I was flippantly told by Gal #2 that they were \\'sorry\\' and would refund the cost of the flowers.\\n\\n* The time was now a bit after 11 a.m. and I was extremely irritated.  What put me over the edge, though, was when Gal #2 said that she had talked with her supervisor about my horrible experience and that her supervisor was willing to give me \"the best compensation that they\\'ve ever extended to someone\":  a $20 in-store coupon.\\n\\n* That was IT!!!   Incredulously, I told her that she AND her supervisor must be drunk to think that I would EVER spend another penny with this company and, furthermore, that pitiful gesture was the final straw - so I canceled my ENTIRE order!\\n\\nI am overwhelmingly disgusted by this company who, by the way, is NOT a local florist in the area that I wanted flowers delivered to (which is exactly how they advertised themselves).  Sadly enough, based on what I\\'ve since read/discovered about this unreputable company, I\\'m not their first victim.  Understandably, I consider this entire rotten experience with Ava\\'s Flowers to be nothing short of a waste of time AND money - at best.   They have yet to refund my $208.18  - and the worst of it is that there were NO flowers and plants from my family and me at my cousin\\'s funeral.\\n\\nShame on them!\\n\\nFor the record, I contacted my credit card company and registered a dispute for the charge from Ava\\'s Flowers.  This company has earned every bit of their bad reputation and I cannot UNrecommend them enough!    Buyer beware!\\nEvery item I purchased has great prices and quality.\\nA few days prior to the show date, I looked at a bunch of online ticket sites for an Opera House musical. Got tired of that and went to the one I have used in the past. I trusted that the tickets were legitimate and fairly priced. The no-worries purchase was simple, the ticket links on my phone were convenient, and we enjoyed the show.\\nOrders have always been correct & delivered quickly. I like the email reminders, as well.\\nYou really can\\'t rate until you have had your identity stolen and try to recover. That is when I will be able to tell if you guys are good or not.\\nOrdering from Hockerty was easy and the customer service was great!\\nGreat service!\\nAshley was really nice and very helpful. She was very prompt in communication. Today is the shipping day. Eagerly looking forward to see the ordered product with all the additions!\\nI usually shop at an all natural store for our cat and dog (very expensive!), but PetFlow offers the same products at almost half the price!  I couldn\\'t be any happier with the products we ordered/received and the package came within just a few days!  I will definitely be ordering all of my pet supplies through PetFlow from now on. :)\\nWorst place to buy from!! Never Buy from them!!\\nShipping service is unreliable.\\n\\nMany errors on the website pertaining to product information.\\n\\nOnly reason I shop here is because of the good selection of parts.\\nI bought a refurb Nikon from buydig. The buying process went mostly smoothly. There was a problem with the item, but buydig stepped up with a solution and advice.\\nFree shipping and easy rescheduling of pickup. However, the price was a loss compared to how much I had bought it before.\\nJust found out that a trip booked through them (college kid home for spring break for a week) which I was charged $464.00 would have cost me $311 if I had booked directly through American Airlines.  I did all the work, then I had to ask for the itinerary after the 24 hour period.  There was a problem they created when booking the flight so I had to speak with American Airlines in order to get on their website to choose seats and enter frequent flyer info (how I came across the actual price of the tickets). How can they justify that mark-up.  Will never use this site again and will make sure people know what a rip off it is.\\nI have ordered multiple times from onnit and I was always extremely happy with every step to get my products. The shipping was quick and when my product was held at customs (1 time), customer service resolved the situation to my satisfaction... I will definitely be ordering again\\nI am quite happy with this vendor.  They responded quickly to my request and I achieved a satisfactory outcome,\\nI will definitely recommend & use your parking service.  When we arrived home (flight weather delayed 4hrs.) at 2:00am, your attending was very prompt in picking us up. Helped with all our luggage (Mom\\'s wheelchair)  and had an umbrella handy. All your staff were very knowledgeable & helpful. When we dropped the car off  we were checked in & on our way to the airport in less then ten minutes. Thanks for making parking a breeze.  Most satisfied customer, P. Arentsen\\nEasy and very fast to complete reservation\\nYou stock everything I need, I get my orders in two days. Online ordering is easy. Sturdy shipping boxes.

I know I was worried ordering on line and paying several hundred dollars but I can say I would use them again!\\nGreat variety of books from art to zoology!  All available at a terrific price and I have yet to get one (even if it lists condition as \"acceptable\") that wasn\\'t in much better shape than the used bookstore we used to have in town.  thank you Thriftbooks for helping me indulge my reading habit without breaking the bank!\\nPart arrived on time and corrected problem.\\nBooked a flight with them via telephone to Greece, said I would have a confirmation email within 4 hours, 5 days later and many expensive phone calls ( calls cost £1 per min) and £512 from my account I still have no confirmation email, no flights and no one (according to them) can find my booking, so why take the money then? send around 15 emails and 10 phone calls and getting nowhere apart from poorer each time!\\nGreat, really easy for\\nReasonable pricing and good shipping\\nQuick delivery. Bucket packaged for easy storage. Small footprint. Stored mine along with a 5 gal bucket containing camp stove,fuel canisters, cook set & water filtration system. Did not try food yet but certain it\\'s tasty.\\nI received a cold contact from National Pen.  While I normally throw these away I liked the sample product they had provided and placed an order.  The company was easy to work with and produced my order in a timely manner and I took delivery less than 3 weeks from placing the order.  \\n\\nI will likely us them again in the future for promotional items for my business.\\nThe amount of required info is kind of insane compared to any other site where you can purchase games from. I thought it was fake, and had to do a lot of digging to see if others had used the site before and if they could confirm it being genuine. Luckily, this is a real site, but customers shouldn\\'t have to second guess like that.\\nMy son loved his t shirt\\nFor the price the shipping can\\'t be complained and the products are great\\na lot of days to wait\\nHuge choices in items I was looking for.

But, the shipment was sent timely and were very large, healthy trees.  They were packaged very securely.  The price was very comparable and they offered different sizes....not just the tiny sizes that you usually get with online orders.....hopefully, the trees will be just as great as the shipping experience was.

I have now made my review to help others looking for unbiased reviews. Thanks for being there. A very happy consumer.\\nGreat service from our CheapOair representative.\\nBEST EVER AND NOTHING GETS DELETED!\\nI was relatively clueless, buying my first home was a major process. Months of searching for a house that needed handicap accessibility or little renovation was made easier with the realtor that understood my needs. When it came to all the documentation, the portal made providing documentation and electronic signatures so easy and saved time. Phone calls and emails were almost always responded to with in a couple hours if not immediately.\\nGood to reserve hotel & Easy to find hotel\\nThe product \"Body Mint\" is very good. Understanding I had a current subscription purchase and the schedule was not clear on the web site\\nThese were a perfect fit to replace the tired and broken casters on my Aeron chair. \\n\\nFollowed the recommended method to measure and select the proper caster for my chair, so deciding and ordering was easy.

That is my one stop shopping outlet where I can get everything that I need!\\nThe prices at supplement warehouse are the best on the internet or anywhere in general. The products are totally legitimate brand names and the shipping is extremely fast. The only thing I might critique is the price of shipping but other than that this site is the best for supplements.\\nInitially I was travelling alone and booked the room for 1.  Then my husband decided to make the trip. Rather than just add him as a guest ( the room rate was the same) it was necessary to cancel and rebook.  The room was prepaid and I had already paid the charge on my credit card bill.  Now they have to refund that and recharge again.  Seems like a cumbersome way of doing things\\nfast shipment, prices beyond amazing \\nthank you\\nMy painting was beautiful- it accurately portrays my Black Lab Cleo. It looks so great on my bedroom wall- I had it framed to match my bedroom furniture.\\nExcellent - Mario Roth perfect servise.\\nI love to read and now I\\'ve found a place to buy beautiful books at a fraction of their original price.

Thanks again for this great website.\\ngood job and good response time\\nEasy to create your own phrase.\\nBeautiful pearls, lots of choices, rapid delivery, excellent quality and presentation. This company keeps its promises and really delivers a terrific customer experience.\\nGeorge and the team at Playlist Push have been great!  Very transparent and responsive!  When we started the campaign we spoke with George the founder himself, he explained their methods and the best practices for his platform to help see greater success.  He was honest about the fact that success in a campaign like this is ultimately up to the strength of the song, but his platform will guarantee that curators at least listen and thoughtfully consider your song.  Spotify promo is a difficult business to be in because there are a lot of horror stories but if you only take one thing from this review it should be this: Playlist Push will do exactly what they say they\\'re going to do.  In a world of over-promising and under-delivering that alone can be refreshing.\\n\\nYou can choose to pitch to multiple playlist genres, dance/indie rock/folk/pop etc., and the people who see the most success usually do two or three. For our first time out of the gate we just went with a single genre, because you pay per genre and we were looking at this as our test case. Our campaign saw a growth of over 400% on our monthly listeners and even after the campaign ended our song is still enjoying rapid growth.  The curators provided feedback on why they did or did not choose the song and I was able to understand the thought process.  \\n\\nWe\\'re going to use Playlist Push again and I would encourage anyone who wants to get the ball rolling on their Spotify game to do the same!\\nMy go-to place for all vaping products and accessories.\\nOrdering from Thriftbooks is simple, efficient, and I love being notified when a book I want is available...\\nMy experience with Stair Supplies always flawless from the start.  From design to pricing to delivery to ease of installation I could not have been happier.  My customer is extremely happy with the finished product which is good for us all.\\nWe ordered stylus pens with cases.  Very nice looking pens and they write good also.\\nthe quality of your pens are excellent and the service was fast and professional...thanks\\nGood selection and quick delivery .  A bit pricey .  Shannon is very nice and helpful.\\nI just found an old box, printed out the shipping label and sent it all off at the post office. Super easy and payment arrived soon after. Very satisfied.\\nDaniel delivered superior customer service. He immediately understood my quandary and very efficiently hooked me up with one of the few providers who could do a same-day weekend activation. Add to that his personable demeanor and perfect diction and you have the ingredients for the best customer service experience I have had in a very long time, if not ever.\\n\\n[For the record, I almost never take the time to offer positive feedback, let alone gush. Nope, my thing is letting the organization know that talking to a parrot in a distant call center who repeats everything I just said by way of attempting to sound sympathetic causes me to start pressing the ice pick harder and harder into my temple. \"I understand how frustrating it must be that your package was not delivered on the date that you were promised.\" So know that I have a pretty high threshold for being pleased.]\\n\\nAnyway, thanks Daniel. I am enjoying an evening of air conditioning while being not murdered.\\nLegacy is a great and understanding company. I have referred them to my friends.\\nI purchased an ac compressor from this company. I took the car to the mechanic and he said that there should have been an orfice tube and accumulator. They sold me this product where I  assumed that it was the best price which included  the orfice tube and ac accumulator. The sales person did tell me that I needed these items because they were not included. This is unethical and deceptive advertising.\\nSeasoned travel company that has great connections at wonderful tropical locations.  Not one hitch while on my 6 night vacation in the Dominican Republic.\\ni dealt with the 3rd time with this company,did not have problem at all.sometimes in high seasons,the rental companies can provide you with an old,exhausted car that nobody will drive!but this is due to high demand.but in normal times,everything was fine.and would like to thank the chania(crete,greece) rental car provider.was great dealing with this specific company.\\nThe items arrived promptly.\\n\\ntvgriffij\\nThank you very much for your support \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a great tool, the process did something scary not knowing or having the page references, but I can say they are very serious and I recommend 100% their use!\\nI was excited to receive my parcel, and it arrived punctually. The peace I had that first night was so welcome! And it got me into the habit of sleep, which has since meant I don\\'t always have to use them- but I take them everywhere just in case! So sleeplessness is not a common event now in my life.\\nI made a purchase, gave my phone number and I wasn’t in the system.\\nIf you want a trusted tour or day excursion visit viator.com.  Very easy site to navigate.  Great options for every city or country.  Great guides and reasonable pricing for every budget.  Thank you viator for offering these tours for us to enjoy.\\nFast service.\\nI had my resume reduced from a long 3 page document to a 1 pager that stood out against the rest! It captured all my skills, key points of experience and made the information easy to read. My resume builder was easy to work with and made all my edits without issue. I have been called in for 3 interviews in the past two weeks thanks to my new resume!\\ngreat company and service\\nBoots are great quality and soooo wonderfully priced!!! Will definitely shop here in the future.\\nLuke from auto city is awesome great customer service\\nVery reliable!\\nWe owed the IRS for a mistake we made.  We contacted Optima and they stepped in and handled the issue with a professionalism that is hardly ever seen today.  We were able to talk with real people whenever we wanted and they kept us up to date with each step.  Contact with the IRS was limited to normal notices with none of those threats of collections or other actions.  Our issue was solved in a manner way better than we expected.\\nHaving just had my windows and doors installed by Callum Fraser, I am very happy with the whole process from the initial consultation right through to the fitting.  No pushy salesmen, friendly and honest.  The installation went smoothly, they have completed the job quickly and it looks great.  They cleaned up afterwards.  I would not hesitate to recommend this company to anyone.\\nI received just what I ordered and received it in a very timely matter!\\n1st time buyer, I bought it one size bigger just in case the size chart was not \"accrued\" but there was no need, the dress is beautiful and perfect. Trust the size chart! Tip from a curvy lady. Love the dress\\nSet up made everything easy to find and ordering was very easy and straightforward.\\nWhile booking Hotels, there is no option to choose Child in the Mobile App. This could be blind spot for the hotels and the customers. If we don\\'t choose the big rooms then it will be very challenging to stay.\\nI have used U-Ship about 6 times and have had a good experience each time.\\nBooks are sent in timely manner.  Sometimes the condition isn\\'t up to described standards, e.g., \"good\" had major underlining on every page, but Thriftbooks refunded the purchase price immediately.\\nlove the condition of the books, looks just like as if you were buying a book from a book store like Barnes and Nobles. Also you cant beat the prices of the books either.\\nFrom the moment I got to the store, the workers were friendly and helpful. When the sofa was being delivered to me, the workers were friendly and helpful.\\nThe service when I contacted Voidhawk about an item that I needed was excellent.  Received the item when they told me when to expect the item.Highly recommend.\\nexcellent services, safe and secure\\nAdt communication & service was beyond my expectations!\\nBeautiful, unique, and quality material and products, fast delivery!\\nThe title says it all.\\n\\nI used the handyman feature first to get the front door lock changed. Paid over $135 to handy, and another $125 for the lock itself. The handyman was good, no complaints on that or the job he did.\\n\\nI had wanted to try the cleaning service since I received an email saying that I would get 50% off my first time cleaning. When I went to schedule the appointment through the app, I found that i couldn\\'t use the promo code, because I had already used handyman services less than a week ago. How that makes sense, I\\'m not sure.\\n\\nI then contacted the company, wasted my time speaking to various people, and no one could honor the 50% off. I will get my house cleaned elsewhere. \\n\\nNot a good customer service experience.\\nVery positive and awesome customer service was able to help.\\nLoved the shoes, but the swimsuit arrived without any protective lining and had some marks on it. Unfortunately it was on sale and so I can\\'t return it.\\nThe driver arrived ten minutes early. He was professional, knowledgeable, and an excellent driver. I was very pleased with the experience.\\nI love it!!! Shows off my body just right! Makes me feel strong and independent\\nStraightforward ordering. Can\\'t wait to receive our bulbs!\\nVery easy and helped me travel with my pet!\\nGood service, I just wish their re-order system was a little easier to use. But they have dedicated reps, so if you get in a bind they can help.\\nThis business model is maddening. It is absolutely ridiculous that if I forget to \"skip the month\", the credit that I receive cannot be applied to sale items. It\\'s marketed like it\\'s a great thing to have a credit, but it\\'s a punishment. I could not wait to use up my credit and then cancel.\\nI am a latest victim and sent out my money without reply and response from their staff. Today, I research on the website and they are Scams/Crooks. How are victim\\'s next step? I do not know.\\nGoogle search \"FTC Says Marketing Firm Left Inventors Empty-Handed\"\\nLove buying books from Thrift Books. Never pay full price for books when you can buy them here, shipping is awesome as well!\\nI imagine that the team at Passports and Visas is used to dealing with VERY stressed people, and I was no different.  They over-delivered - getting our passports back to us almost 5 days ahead of the promised date (they don\\'t really control all parts of this process, so don\\'t count on it).  Vacation was saved.  They were solid on communication, updates and keeping me calm.  Very grateful.\\nThis is a fantastic company to do business with and the quality is excellent. I have had many compliments on my business cards.\\nfast and reliable, makes my trip easier.\\nFast response and it cleared things up for me, very helpful. Thank you.  Steve w.\\nGreat prices and all books received in greater than expected condition\\nRecently I\\'d seen Greek, and Roman mysteries and Christmas cookbooks advertised on tv, current book sellers, and in magazines .  I searched Thriftbooks.com and found all of them in good condition and much, much cheaper.  The shipping from various sources is fast.  I\\'ve ordered books from here in the past and have not been disappointed at all.  Also, the Wish List is handy for listing any out of stock book that I may want.  Soon I get a notice when it is in stock and  if I still want it. .  Such service is hard to beat!\\nMy only change would be to give the customer the choice between using FedEx or UPS.  I hate UPS but was forced to use them.  In addition, I chose to drop my clubs off and the UPS office is further away.  Otherwise, it was quick and easy.\\nQuick delivery. The product is good used condition. Pleased\\nAwesome customer service and great products!  We received our cards before they said they would be here and they look amazing.  We would recommend them to everyone.\\nEasy to use. Found best price on multiple flights after getting an update letting me know the price dropped.\\nthis work good no problem thanks and i will keep using this site\\nThe cost of the travel was great but the service provided was very inadequate. It took us a long time before receiving our itenary after booking. The agent we spoke to provided us with the wrong information about our travel and we were honestly not happy with the choice of flight. \\nThe hotel was great.\\nGood service, only thing I\\'d say is price can be slightly misleading at first\\nHad to call me twice for shipping instructions, parts came a month later.\\nI booked with my card and there was problem with it, they took the reservation and the money, but when I went to the office in Dubai to get the car, my card was not acceptable anymore, for it was a debit card and not credit card.\\r\\nThey did not accept any other payment means and told us we will get a refund.\\r\\nToday, they informed us that we would not get any refund and that it was their policy.\\r\\nTo sum up, No car, No refund, and it is normal for them.\\r\\nI believe paying for something and and getting neither the car neither the refund, it is unacceptable.\\nCustomer service is outstanding. A young man called Ross was helping us with our order and nothing was to much trouble. He emailed me back quickly and helped sort out any queries we had. As for the controller it\\'s amazing (in the words of my son) I was nervous about spending that amount of money but I\\'ve got to say it\\'s worth every penny!!\\nWell done Scuff Gaming for outstanding product and service.\\nOrder arrived in a damaged package. Trousers inside were dirty. Asked for assistance from the customer support  - no reply. Avoid at all cost. Unacceptable conduct.\\nPlaqueMaker did a fabulous job fo me. I needed 175 plaques for a big event in a short time and they delivered early and did everything they said they would. I would highly recommend them and will definitely use them again.\\r\\nThank You\\nProduct is as advertised; arrived earlier than expected.\\nGreat jeans!

This website always has double cash back than other similar websites.\\nI have been ordering from these people since just about the get-go. I think they were two years old when I found them. I need a northern supplier-other suppliers just don\\'t know our challenges. They have replaced seed that didn\\'t germinate(very likely NOT their fault), dug up some seed for me that was not in the current catalogue, given me advice on phone, answered question patiently, orders come on time, I trust their testing processes. and all in all, I love this company, the staff and comfort of ordering from friends.\\nWe were just moving apartments from downstairs to upstairs.  We needed help with the big stuff like couches, washer and dryer and such. Booking was super easy and they were very helpful. They told me that the crew would be here between 9-9:30 am, but they showed up at 8am. That was the only negative I could say. Maybe next time call the customer if you’re going to be coming before they’re expecting. Other than that the move went great, crew was very helpful and we accomplished what I was hoping to in the 2 hours we had them.\\nI always get the help I need (and usually quickly) when I search for a provider on HomeAdvisor.\\nOrdered a tactical vest. Had a question after the order. Received a quick response. Order arrived on time. Was well packaged.

The only thing i love about fabletics are the leggings.\\nReservation was quick, easy, and affordable.  Parking was easy to find, van was on time, all went well.\\nBooked a couple of flight tickets and the whole experience was great. I recently worked with Nasima and she went an extra mile to get the best deal. Looking forward to working with Flyopedia again :)\\nI bought 2 Twinlab Whey Protein 1 Lb each, I received the wrong product, with new formulation and less weight 0.83 Lb each.\\nExtremely difficult to reach service agent by phone. Had to give up after waiting over one hour to be connected to an agent on two occasions.\\nIt came quicker than expected and I love the quality!\\nSo far, so good.   It was a serendipitous find, not quite where we had started looking.   The booking process was quite easy.   However, we were charged for the rental before we actually got the contract.  The contract listed many restrictions that were not indicated on the website when we booked.  Did the restrictions change our minds?  No,   I think that if a property comes with restrictions (no personal watercraft, such as a kayak, when the house is on a lake), well, those restrictions should be prominently displayed prior to booking.\\nReal Good people\\nSo quick, easy, affordable and convenient!\\nalways there on line or in store to help\\nThe people here are great, first rate customer service, always willing to help. Motion media has a great variety of software at great prices.\\r\\nWell Done!\\nKyle was attentive and listened to me as I voiced my concerns.

Very polite, informative and patient. \\r\\n  Joe @ PeggyJo Walls\\nFantastic caviar. It all tasted amazing. Will definitely order again!\\nI would not join this survey site. Never qualify for any surveys and it takes forever to reach the cash out threshold. When I finally did reach the amount needed to cash out, I never received my payment. I have not taken any surveys since not receiving payment.\\nI give 1star because I can\\'t give 0. It\\'s the  worse company that I ever seem.  I suppose to receive a package today, and I was waiting the whole day and tracking the package when the person that supposed to bring it writes that they came and no one was here.  That was not true, I didn\\'t leave the house a second, I was with my phone the whole day.  They didn\\'t left any paper saying that they came,but  they write down that they came in the tracking information. I call twice and nobody seems to care about it. And the only answer was that I have to wait until the next day,  and they will deliver to a access point,  no even in my address.\\nI will recommend Rebtel for everyone\\nVery respectful technician, had everything hook up and working within an hour.\\nThis was a very meaningful way to memorialize someone who recently died.  The family was deeply touched by the gesture and loved the materials that came with the certificate.  I highly recommend the Star Name registry.\\nThis is the second time I\\'ve used LiveAgent and should there ever be a need for a third for a new venture, it\\'s a no brainer.\\nHello all. Using rentalcars for 5+ years without any concerns. And actually today was pushed to rate this site for 1 star only due to absolute unprofessionalism from the staff of this company. \\nLong story short - I have booked E class in Italy from GreenMotion through RentalCars. Have printed confirmation of E class booking. Have email voucher with confirmed status. After several weeks on the web site it was silently changed to C class. I noticed this occasionally when was trying to book another car for my friend. I have a mail thread with rentalcars customer support with official apologies and confirmation of internal error caused this incident. Plus I have the same mail confirmation from customer support that E class will be booked for me from another vendor. As a result today I received a notice that no one is responsible and nothing will be changed. And if I have any concerns I could cancel my booking (go far far away) or open customer support case AFTER the booking. So now I have no time to do anything by myself (no cars are available)\\nVery upset, guys. Reputation of this wonderful service is ruined.\\nThis site makes quality signs out of various materials that would meet most sign requirements. I have used them for business and for my church.\\r\\nHigh quality and FAST at a reasonable price.\\nI worked with Hovhannes and I was able to get help in a s month and easy process !\\nI needed some parts for my RV generator and really wanted to have them before the next weekend\\'s trip.  I searched high and low on Amazon since I have Amazon Prime but was unable to find the parts I needed at a reasonable price.  Dyers came up in my search and they had the parts at a reasonable price and shipping was also reasonable.  The only question in my mind is whether or not I would get them in time.  I decided to give them a shot.  I placed the order on Sunday morning and my parts arrived on Wednesday afternoon.   I believe I paid $8 for regular shipping.  I got the parts installed on Wednesday night and our generator worked flawlessly for our weekend of tailgating.   This is great service and I will look to Dyers again when I am searching for RV parts and supplies.\\nCompletely and utterly terrible and unacceptable my dress came in a box which was completely wrecked my dress was torn the strap had fallen off and threads were coming out all over I will never use this site again and will do everything in my power to prevent others from using this site I feel as though I was scammed\\nDiverse offering of quality olive oil with option of organic growers. Well packaged and timely delivery. Prefer selecting my own when I need to reorder over those companies that auto ship their choice available.\\nFittings good and looks classy.\\nYouvee was patient and took her time to explain the entire process and answer all of my questions. I would definitely recommend their services\\nOverall the content covered enough material to get you a passing mark. However the publisher could have done a better and more thorough job of ensuring the words and phrases used matched with the words and phrases that Transport Canada uses. Where it did not match it caused confusion and uncertainty in making the correct multiple choice selection. \\n\\nI passed with a 94% but I used my full time allotment to struggle over some of the confusing questions.\\nI had ordered 4 wardrobe cabinets when the cabinets arrived the the 3 point locking rod assembly was missing on all 4 of the cabinets. Now I have 4 cabinets that I can do nothing with. I tried emailing customer service about my issue and have not received any email or information back.\\nArtwork exactly as shown. Pieces have always shipped promptly and are well packed.\\nHow this company is able to stay afloat is beyond me. Have used WU for years and about every three months all my online business just comes to a halt and the last time I finally had to set up a new email to use WU. I was told my account was closed for inactivity even thoughwas using it every week. I am sure someone I upset just went in and shut it down. Believe me if the other companies that do this were any better would use them but they aren\\'t. How I wish I could find another way to send money. Oh and by the way I lost about 75 points when that first account was closed. What a ripoff WU is for sure!\\nRyonet has always come through for me.  When I recently had a problem with one of their products, they handled the problem promptly and professionally.\\n\\nI plan to order from them again--probably later today.\\nSeamless, flawless and timely..

I feel motivated to work out when I wear the brand, and I am always excited to see what new outfits the next month will bring.\\nI really like CafePress.  For the ~$30 or so we spent per shirt, I would have expected a higher quality product.\\nYour representative was great, but the dentist she referred me to never answered the phone or called back after leaving a few messages...\\nJust started my policy\\nWe ordered two mugs from CafePress and while we received them on time and they were what we ordered, we thought the designs we chose would be located on both sides of the mugs.  They were perfect except for we would have preferred designs on both sides so no matter how we handled the mugs we\\'d see the scenes we wanted to see.\\nBest price and fast shipping! We live in Hawaii, found your website after a month of looking online and found you, your site was nice and customer service was spot on.  Prices were better than anyone else, and great product and packed perfect!  Shipping was so fast! Thanks Joy🤙🏼\\nThe lady i talked to on the phone was so extremely helpful. She knew exactly what she was doing, and even offered to add the upgrade since it\\'s our honeymoon without me even mentioning it. It was an extremely good experience.\\nVery good selections and good prices.\\nAlways feel taken care of here\\nI love UAE exchange all the staff are very polite anf accomodating and very good exchange rate\\nI used HomeAdvisor to find a hardwood flooring person and an electrician.  In both instances they put me in contact with competent contractors who did great work at fair prices.\\nConvenient for direct bank deposit even if its holidays both california and philippines.\\nWould be a 5 PLUS....but it took too much effort to get a receipt.  An invoice.  Strongly recommend them.  Yes, I do, make no mistake.  Everyone can improve on something - nothing is perfect.  But a simple itemized receipt? A quick win as an easy thing to improve.  Please.  You\\'re too good to have something so minor mar your attractiveness as a business entity.    ... I would still do business with them again - and gladly so.\\nCould do better in a couple of areas. One being PayPal should be offered to international members and the second is a currency converter which they had a one time which I really liked . Lets you know exactly what you will be paying if you do not live in the US.\\nMost transaction can be tracked automatically.  Even if transaction are not tracked still could submit a trace form manually.  And most of the transaction has cashback promptly.  It is worth the extra step while doing the online shopping.\\nUsed them for many years and always had a great trip.\\nGreat customer service. However the AC in our vehicle wasn\\'t working properly.\\nSupport is great, and games are excellent. Just needed more games in the future, Hope they add betsoft games\\nI was able to talk to real people, not machines!  They listened and immediately solved my problem, shipped ASAP the items that were missing.  Pleasant.  A refreshing company to do business with.  They actually seemed to care!  Thank you so much\\nThe ordering process was simple and I was able to get exactly what I wanted. The communication was good and delivery was promised.\\nFast friendly service, thanks again\\nWhere is my stuf ? Now 17 days\\nFor the last 8 to 10 years I had been buying products from Displays2go to re-sale in Puerto Rico to my customers. Like I said before the service and products are great , the only complaint is that they do not offer me a better pricing for re- sale , I get the same price that everybody else and that is not fair. Thank you.\\nI can buy the same items that I can buy in the stores but only less expensive!\\nGreat choices of music shopping  but the shipping took to long to process.  I had to call customer service  to get the order processed after a week of no action.\\nI have appreciated the work that the Lodmill group has done for my family and me.

I would order from them again in a heartbeat!\\nFast shipping\\nThe serviceman, Joe, was very knowledgeable and did a great job.\\nI would give 0 starts if I could. !!!\\n\\nI always order everything for my work address and there\\'s never been any problem. We\\'re open every single day, all day. From the morning till 11 o\\'clock in the evening. For 2 weeks YODEL didn\\'t deliver my parcel. This is the worst company ever, everyone I know had the same bad experience with them as me. On the tracking website at first I got the information that they\\'ve missed me and left a card. They couldn\\'t miss me cause it\\'s open all day, and there was no card for me or whatsoever. I rearranged the delivery day, they didn\\'t come again. So I rearranged again and picked address automatically, wrote down only postcode and all the rest chose automatically from the box. Next day I got the text message on the that parcel has been delievered succesfully through the letterbox and its been signed. Literelly I\\'ve been sitting at work, behind the desk when i got the text, in front of the door.. no one came there. Theres no letterbox.. 2 big doors made of glass, no letterbox anywhere. Is it some kind of joke ? I called YODEL, asking wheres my parcel, they said it was a mistake and the lady said courier has the parcel today and it\\'ll be deliever today. No one came.. After that I coudn\\'t rearrange delivery again because in the system my parcel has been delivered. DO NOT CHOOSE THIS COMPANY ! WAIST OF TIME ! That all proccess took 2 weeks and i still don\\'t have my stuff.\\nExcellent and friendly web site booking\\nThe service is good. Better than Spectrum.\\nI was very happy to find this product. I served in that unit in Vietnam and have been looking for those exact decals. They arrived early and in perfect shape. I\\'m very satisfied with CafePress and will be ordering more.\\nNice easy checkout and selection!\\nWe have always had good results with RC Willey.  Even when there has been an issue pertaining to a specific purchase, they have always been very kind to resolve the issue.  I like RC Willey!\\nI love the Taylor of Old Bond Street line of products.\\nGreat wines at great prices!\\nAfter finding out the Reeds store didn\\'t have my correct size the associate said, \"No problem!\" She ordered the correct size and it arrived in a timely manner and I was even in a different state when she ordered. Wonderful customer service!\\nTruly the best Paella I\\'ve ever eaten, and best service as well!\\nRubbish website and even worse customer service when trying to establish what was wrong. Ended up having to go into a shop to buy boots.\\nI got everything I needed to get within a day and they were so much cheaper than the other websites.\\nOverall I really like asgi and have purchased from them several times. I am not a fan that you cannot apply coupon codes until right before you pay but otherwise asgi is one of the best airsoft sites.\\nWe have 2 subscriptions, one for me and one for my son..\\r\\n\\r\\nEach month it\\'s like getting a present, that is worth twice what was paid for it.\\nI like many people on One.com were forced to pay renewal fees for a domain even though I had asked to cancel my account and all they do in response to my emails is quote their terms and conditions. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne would think when you ask to cancel and then you get an email reply from One.com saying that your webspace is cancelled the matter is settled. No, not at all One.com instead has a company called Intrum Justitia that send you threatening letters about how you did not pay and they have sent you so many reminders and SMS\\'s that now they will get a judgement against you. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo in the end after many emails back and forth between myself and their customer support trying to find an amicable middle ground I ended up paying the £20 and being done with it, because this is a company that does not stand by it\\'s word and will not see the customers side. They are here for the quick buck, so I hope the £20 serves you well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have to say I was a faithful customer of 6 years with another one of my domains with One.com but since this experience I have now also cancelled my other domain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have to say that I am deeply sorry for the other people on this site as I thought they were few and far between but as I have been reading the other reviews there are more and people that One.com treats this way and has absolutely no business ethos.\\r\\n\\r\\nP.s. Oh and wait, I bet you they will reply with some Terms and Conditions! ;)\\nReal, new, working parts. I was hesitant but its all legit and cheaper than the auto stores here.\\njust recently bought macbook air and iPhone... and??\\r\\ni am alread head over the heel!!!\\r\\nthe unbelievable speed, the quality and the apps!!\\nI have been very pleased with everything billiards!!  Service tech/repairman is excellent and very professional!!\\nGreat price & user friendly access\\nI use the site for many things from internet searches to watching tv to shopping. They always pay.\\nI first tried the trial packets and like them so I decided to buy a bundle and I got the cookies and cream tub and I honestly can\\'t drink this one it doesn\\'t taste good at all. It wasn\\'t one of the trial\\nPackets I got I wish I would\\'ve tried it first because I really liked some of the other ones.\\nthe right part on time and very economical\\nI have had great difficulty in receiving product on a timely basis. Even after receiving part orders, \\'live chats\\' with an IdealShape CSR the resolution has been poor.  (The CSR did great, but his hands are tied by poor decisions/planning from others in the company).  As  much as we like the product, we are looking to switch to another as we simply cannot count on the distribution.\\nI enjoyed using Aceable although the content of the lesson is on the boring side. The only thing for me on the downside was that it took me much more than 4 hrs to do. Maybe it\\'s just me?\\nI found a way to book multiple flights that didn\\'t wear me out. First I looked in all the usual places and quite by accident discovered JustFly. I liked the interface and hope all goes well with the flights.\\nThis course was very helpful to take. I loved it.\\nOne of their cakes was sent to me as a birthday present via FedEx. The driver left it outside the door, and when I retrieved it, there were about 500 ants inside the box, even inside the cheesy plastic wrap for the cake. The only thing to do with it was discard it in the trash. So I cannot comment on the edibility of the cake. However, when I contacted customer service via their web site, I was sent an e-mail telling me to call a customer number. When I did, I was put on hold for about five minutes, when a man came on, asking me what my problem was. When I told him, he put me on hold for another five minutes, and I hung up. In my estimation, you are totally wasting your time, money, and sanity when dealing with this stupid company.\\nIf I could give it zero stars, I would.\\nNo complaints really.  It would be nice if they had more views of their products so you could better see exactly what you were getting, but then again it is just a light socket that costs a couple of bucks, so I may be expecting too much.\\nThe booking process was easy, the owner quickly responded to the first request and several questions after.  The entire trip was great.\\nI\\'ve used VRBO for our family summer vaction for several years.  I give them 4 1/2 stars!  Its my second time this year using VRBO/HomeAway.\\nI didn\\'t expect the extra fee added to use VRBO/HomeAway this year. \\nThe fee varied according to the cost of the rental.\\nFast, easy and no hidden fees. Anastasia Was awesome. She has helped me several times in the past years.\\nTHANKS ONDECK!\\nI ordered two books. Both are paperbacks. They arrived in great condition and in the time line given when i placed the order\\nVery good customer service!\\nI finally gave up trying to use amazon prime with 1000bulbs  as I could not find the items I needed so I ordered direct from 1000bulbs and am not too happy with the high shipping charge.\\nI have had great success with using this online storage auction site. I do wish that there were more online auctions closer to my home. Maybe Storage Treasures will partner with more Santa Clarita storage unit businesses.\\nGreat sensible website, quick shipping, great product.  Thank you !\\nabout the customer service it takes a little longer  to wait but its helps me though its more cheaper to buy a ticket here than the other website thanks\\nWould recommend\\nSpoke with Joe Totah, helped me setting everything up and it was amazing and fast. Very friendly and good team work with Roam Hicks in finalizing the entire process from head to toe. Thanks guys\\nSurvey Junkie is one of the best survey sites I use! So easy to do the surveys and redeem the points!\\nIt is great to get reviews of businesses from those who have used them but your automated system almost pesters us users to death with the constant emails to rate this or that. It appears the just viewing the phone number of a vendor is enough to trigger the \"tidy up\" automated process and it will not stop until you have told the computer that either you did not use this vendor or give that vendor a rating. I use Angie\\'s LIst to save time but seem to spend some of my precious time responding to your computerized emails to rate a vendor I never used. Annoying. Other than that, a great service.\\nOrdering was easy, no problem there. Ordered contacts on November 22 and still haven\\'t received them and it\\'s December 7th. When I contacted tech support the first time they said they would call me the next day at a scheduled time. They didn\\'t call during that time and I had to call them. They said USPS lost my shipment and that they would resend. Still waiting...\\nThanks Guys,\\n\\nHad a great experience with the on-line chat option. I got really quick helpful responses from the Team.\\nSometimes the call quality is very bad. Need to improve on that.\\nCorrect part ordered and received in a timely and affordable manner.\\nI received fast shipping, great customer service and my items came on time as promised.\\nThis was nothing more than a regular taxi cab ride. Our driver was on speaker phone the entire car ride (45 mins) to the airport. Not only was his conversation annoying to listen to but it made me feel unsafe that he was not paying attention to the road. He did not once ask us if we were comfortable. I would be hesitant to use his service ever again as a taxi ride is even less expensive!\\nEasy to setup and check inquiries. Thanks for helping us sell our RV,would recommend highly\\nThis was my first time shopping, I am very satisfied with the transaction.  The price was great, delivery was quick, engraving was perfect.  If only shipping was free!!\\nI will be back for more games, thank you HRKGames  :)\\nExcellent, fast, easy, high quality service.\\nHorrible, I didn\\'t receive the item I paid for.. Need to return immediately\\nThis is my first time using Printingblue and I am very satisfied with the print job I ordered....the service was wonderful and all my questions were answered professionally and PROMPTLY.....which is important, non?  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe best news of all is that my CLIENT is over-the-moon pleased with the job — which is what we\\'re in business for in the first place!  I hope to have many projects printed here!\\nEverything was great. Will be a returning customer.\\nAwesome service very fast!\\nAmazing customer service and the food was great!!!\\nI\\'m very satisfied with the service. It\\'s easy for users to access the website, find suitable hotels with its friendly design structure, quick loading and moreover, responsible reply from staffs.\\nMy family and I truly enjoyed the Fat Tire Bike Tour of Paris.  We were a family of 8 adults and 3 children.  We all got the bikes we wanted, including my 7-year old grandson.  For our two 5-year old grandchildren who didn\\'t know how to bike yet, a trailer was attached to one of the adult bikes and they too enjoyed the tour.  Our tour guide, Kirstie, was fantastic!  She had a lovely Scottish lilt and made the history of Paris come alive!  It felt like she was just relating a story that happened yesterday.  I learned so much more about  Paris, French history, they way Paris as a city was planned than I ever had during past trips.  And biking around made us feel like local Parisians.  Kirstie took good care in guiding us safely through the busy streets of Paris.  Everyone in my family thinks that the Bike tour was the best!\\nI love the styles and it was an easy choice.\\nWell designed, sleek, contemporary and very practical!\\nThis is the site to buy gold and silver from.  I have used others but they are prompt and secure and I will buy from them in the future.\\nEasy to find what I wanted.\\nThis is my first purchase. It is a great product.\\nThank you for your good work. Quality product managed by quality people.\\nVery satisfied with my experience.\\nGreat product.  Some minor issues with delivery and delivery team but promptly fixed by 1StopBedrooms. Very Satisfied.\\nI absolutely love the glass sugar packets containers I purchased. I share some of them with my sisters and they loved them too.\\nLooking for a quick service avaliable for my iPhone 5C, I needed something to clear up some unlocking requests so the phone could be used internationally for family use. The issue was the phone was bought by a 3rd party and when unlocking, it would return an unable to unlock due to unpaid history. This was annoying since I really needed the phone to work and ended up using the service. At first, they charged $17 USA to run a semi unlock. Within a week, they emailed back saying I needed a premium unlock which costed an additional $63 USA. The total was about $80 to unlock but after a total amount of 20 whole days from start date to end with unlock email, it was successful. Took a while considering the time frame was said to be 3-15 days but better late then never. Thank you for the good service!\\nI put the material together as per the instructions on the web site,  sent in the package, and wham, before they  promised, I received my passport.  I couldn\\'t be more pleased.  Good job Travel Visa Pro!\\nThe order when it arrived already he one orange that mildew and they really pretty all over ripe when recieved.\\nBooking was easy, now I\\'m looking forward to smooth flying.\\nWe got our mattress topper quickly. Dissatisfied with product. 4.5 inch topper- top portion is to be 1.5 inches of blend of gel fiber fill. It is less than 1 inch and is a polyester and polyurethanes foam, not cool at all.\\nGood list of contractors who were not in our phone book.  Timely referral to Reidhead plumbing.\\nWeb sight easy to use and price was the best\\nI rate WalletHub\\'s search tool as excellent. Many factors contribute to my rating, primarily search result relevance, convenience, and speed.The search tool was exceptional in all three aspects. I searched for \"savings account\" to see the best financial institutions nearby. Not only did the search tool return a gigantic list of banks, but also options that matched my expectations. There is a nice filter within the search tool, so I will get the best results. I can also switch from specific categories, such as CD/Savings, Checking, and Mortgages. I can even search for answers to my questions under the community tab. Overall, I am very impressed by WalletHub\\'s search tool!\\nTesting.com has helped my kids to acheive high scores in their academic. My son has improved a lot in Math as well as the way he should understand the questions to solve the problems in more strategic ways. He\\'s more confident and comfortable while writing tests at school.\\nDirt cheap games, instantly received keys. It\\'s great.\\nExtremely fast delivery, so fast I was stunned!  Product is as beautiful as expected, great quality and  fit.  Very pleased and would purchase again without hesitation.  Thank you!\\nEverything came out fine, they gave me exactly what I requested. The only thing I did not like was the thickness of the paper for application. As my background was black office plaques, it was difficult to see through it for positioning. Otherwise I was totally satisfied.\\nThe whole process was went well. I liked the fact that I was emailed about my package movement. I just don\\'t like the fact that it is delivered without my presence. But still I will use and recommend them.\\nThe product was shipped out in a timely manner. The deal was excellent.\\nRainbow is very fast good quality\\nThe book was in excellent condition and arrived sooner than expected - good job!\\nIt was an easy process to receive the money!\\nI was hesitant about fat burners , however the order from suppz meet and exceeded my expectations and has helped me loose fat\\nIt was easy to locate a flight that worked for me at the cheapest price.

I will buy from them again...\\nTatianna was very helpful with helping me update my contact email address as well as helping me cancel my account\\nKnowledgeable lawyers, efficient staff. I feel comfortable that my assets are protected. Would recommend this firm to anyone who needs asset protection\\nVIP provide an easy to use service that is very cost effective. Particularly like the fact they only take a deposit on booking not the full amount like most companies. Used several times with excellent results, but on last occasion the rental company provided a small SUV when a large one was booked; annoying at the end of a 10 hour flight.\\r\\nOverall would definitely continue using VIP and would recommend to anyone.\\nGreat CS team. Thank you!\\nIt was very easy to order on-line and very fast delivery. Thank you and Merry Christmas.\\nWhen we arrived at the hotel to check in with my booking voucher we had to wait nearly an hour whilst the booking was checked and confirmed as Amona had failed to notify the hotel of the booking! The hotel was very apologetic however I was left frustrated and annoyed thinking that I had been scammed and it wasted nearly an hour of our weekend sorting out an administration error.\\nWe spend our winters in the USA and were introduced to XE by a good friend. I have had 2 occasions to call XE with a question and each time I got through in just a few seconds and in both cases my questions were answered by knowledgable and competent people.\\nWe recently transferred about 3500 dollars US from our Canadian bank account. No fees and the difference between that transaction and what we would have received at our \"big six\" was $80 in our favour. We use the CSA currency exchange as well for monthly transfers but for ad hoc requirements and for our RBC US dollar visa payment this is ideal.\\nOnce the XE account is established with links to the bank accounts used, the process is flawless and efficient. Highly recommended!\\nShopping at Bambi Baby was a great experience. Staff is very knowledgeable. Would recommend.\\nPurchased non-HP refills for printer.  Received in just a few days.  Great service\\nProcess was simple and quick.  So far so good.\\nGreat company, fast shipping! I’m very pleased!\\nused these lamps in the past, very dependable\\nShipping was crazy expensive. This needs to be corrected. I paid a 1/4 more in shipping costs. I was prepared to pick the item up at the store. This is very deceptive and frustrating. I would suggest you figure out another alternative. I could have drove to Chicago and picked it up myself and drove back for cheaper than what you charge. How about give people the option to pickup at the store for no charge. Dont plan on going back and still on the fence about cancelling my order. \\nPro: Sales person was nice and helped me get what I needed though.\\nID Wholesaler made sure we got our last minute order shipped and received by the dates we needed. Great Customer Service!\\nI\\'ve tried a few leather cleaning kit before but the one I purchased from the Furniture Clinic was beyond my imagination! It\\'s no nonsense product and totally worth the price. I would definitely recommend it!\\nDon\\'t order from them. They don\\'t check the proof really well . They just skimmed through my order and didn\\'t find the misspelled word. Now my wedding invitations are all wrong and they should have caught it.\\nVery easy site to navigate.  Great choices with many colors, sizes and inseams.\\nCan\\'t wait to try my first pair of Fabletics leggings!!\\nAgoda cancelled my booking without informing me. They cancelled it 2 days before we turned up at the hotel . 2 days in which they failed to contact me via the verified email address that they had for me or the 2 phone numbers on file. I was stuck in Milan with 2 small children in a fully booked hotel, (they had rebooked our room to another customer). An unhelpful customer service provider at Agoda just made lots of excuses, none valid. We managed to find another family room, difficult in Milan, for twice the price with the help of the original hotel staff. They were as cross with Agoda as I was. Never trust Agoda, book direct with the hotel or use other booking sites. We have never had trouble with Booking.com or TripAdvisor.\\nI will never use Agoda again.\\nEverything came in exactly as shown and was perfect! My wife loved it!\\nI have bought different parts for my cars from Parts Geek, and I\\'ve always got a great deal. The most recent purchase included struts for my minivan. The price was the lowest anywhere, and the struts were delivered with in a couple of days. I had expected them delivered in a week! Parts Geek has me hooked. Any time I need a part they are the first ones I look for.\\nThe guys at Town Fair told me that they were all booked up with appointments but that if I dropped my car off early in the morning they\\'d fit it in and get my winter tires put on.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dropped it off at 7:30 when they opened and my car was done by 9:00! They always do a great job here.\\nI have always had good service from you.\\nI ordered a black, size M, t-shirt with a motorcycle quote for my husband. What I received was a black, size M, t-shirt but with a completely random print. When I called customer service they promised to resend my corrected order with upgraded shipping, which is great but also what you would expect right before Christmas. What irked me though is, that they seemed completely unapologetic for their mistake. Not once have I heard the phrase \"sorry for the inconvenience\" or the like. With so many other similar companies out there, I will not be returning to CafePress again.\\nOrdering my items from the site was fast. But the delivery time it took for me to get my items took way to long. The company could of shipped it faster!\\nParts were delivered on time and as promised. Appears free shipping on many orders of $50.00 or more.  Parts description could be better.\\ngreat cookbook for slow crockpot recipes, and great merchandise!\\nVery courteous and prompt.\\nRequested Enhanced Scheduled Delivery, nobody was available by phone, so completed online. Fingers crossed this goes as smoothly as I hope. If not, will follow up on review.\\nThey are very prompt with responding and trying to correct situations where I received the wrong size of merchandise.  Kudos to their service department.\\nalways trustworthy and thorough been buying from them 7 years now and  will continue. very good customer service\\nI learned about JustFly through Kayak actually, but will use it in future flight purchases! The simplicity of the process made everything very enjoyable, and the price was not beat by anyone!\\nThanks again\\nThey sent it on a freight company that would not delivery to our site (R&L).  We receive deliveries and make shipments all the time with at least a half dozen other freight companies.  To compound the problem they wanted me to pay for an un-deliverable charge.  After a telephone call that was dropped.\\nI\\'ve had nothing but positive results this far.  This is my first year and have two of my largest creditors on done. So far I\\'m happy with NDR.\\nVery good workmanship and answered my questions well.\\nTrustedhousesitters is amazing.  It has allowed us to go away, relax and enjoy our holidays without a worry in the world about our pets and our home.  Each and every one of our house sitters has been superb.  Thank you to all of them and to Trustedhousesitters for such a superb service.  Highly recommended.\\nI have found Vayama to be reliable for good pricing.\\nLots of choice!

I SENT A REQUEST FOR HELP THE E-MAIL I GOT BACK GAVE ME A PART # AND I ORDERED. IT APPEARS THE COUSTOMER SERVICE MEMBER WHO RESPONDED TO MY REQUEST DID NOT READ IT OR DOES NOT KNOW THE DIFFRENCE BETWEEN TAURUS AND TAURUS X , A SUV.\\nLabels arrived right on time and were exactly as shown.

Very good site for buying and selling game items.\\nOrdered on Sunday got it Tuesday.\\nInstantly recharge the prepaid load of mobile phones online. Definitely very useful for my kind of work as a seafarer, anywhere in the world i don\\'t need to worry to recharge my phone.\\nIn the few months I have been dealing with the Easy Comforts people I have had no problem with any of the products so I have no real reason to deal with a problem with them on that front.  I do however have a real problem when it comes to their website and getting help with that.  Ordering is no problem but trying to figure out how to make a payment online is a real problem and no one has helped me with that yet.\\nGreat experience\\nThey have a nice selection of games, especially older ones and I love them for being DRM-free! They also treat developers a lot better than their competitors do.\\n\\nMany games also work on Linux however I\\'d be happier if they offered even more Linux support.\\n\\nTheir prices aren\\'t bad either!\\nEverything went great. I was actually surprised at how lovely the diamonds were when they arrived. Beware that anything over certain dollar value needs secondary confirmation, this held my order up a couple of days but it ended up working out just fine!\\nThe experience of making these for my grand son was amazing to me...and they looked much better when they arrived than I expected.\\nBoth my daughter and I were extremely pleased.\\nI have used this website several times and have been pleased with prompt response.  No complaints.\\nSparefoot is probably the simplest tool to use to find storage space because it has all of the information (including prices) centralized and allows you to book through their site. It also sends out reminders about move-in dates which can be useful.\\nOn time, clean car, reasonable prices, very reliable service, great communication\\nNice hotel, parking easy to access, nice shuttle,  overall, good deal\\nVery easy to search and quick to respond!\\nOutstanding facility; exceptional service.\\nPrompt and careful follow-up on policy matters.

Thank you!\\ngood time of shipping, good product\\nODR did a great job recovering some very important data off a drive for me, quickly and before the dates they said it would be done.  This would be a 5 star review, but the only issue I have is their pricing model.  I would have liked the price to have been based on the amount of data that was actually recovered, not on the total amount of storage on the source drive;\\nIts a great feeling when you order parts online and it is exactly what you described and shipping was prompt.  I love it when my only headache is the project i\\'m working on and not my supply house.  Thanks for being reliable.\\nGREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE\\nI love gog!\\nLove buying from them!\\nGreat product, second pair. Came quickly and well packaged. Now if I can only find them on sale!

Has done a fabulous job with these mysteries!\\nBrandon is an awesome employee he went above and beyond to help my family when we really needed it. He stayed late just to make sure that we were ok and that we had everything we needed to move things into the storage unit. We needed the truck to bring somethings over and he stayed later so that we could unload it and we had to move fast. I just wanted to let anyone know that he is an awesome employee and the units are clean and everything is well taken care of there. If you need a storage unit go see brandon up there!!!Thanks austyn\\nI was very pleased. Ordered the night before and was delivered by promised. The flowers looked just like what was pictured.

Hat came in first, quickly,\\nbut by December 24rth, the 2 calendar (the most expensive orders) didn\\'t show up.  Very disapointed.  When I  tried to track my package, no tracking was available.  Will not order from there again.  I may add to this when the UPS show up to my door...\\nGreat value for bundles and games. Repeat customer No problem at all with transactions.

HUGE selection.\\ni am so satisfied with the service, I was so panic when I just realized that Ive been booking the wrong date at that time, then i would like to change it. I called my dad, he told me that the international flight would not refund me, but I am not giving up. Then, I click the contact person in the sky picker website, i try to ask for a help and tweet them in twitter. They respond me and I saw they really work hard in helping me, if I am not mistaken it takes 12 hours to finished my trouble. I am so grateful because I was booking a ticket in a right place, \"Sky Picker\", for me it is a trusted company with an excellent service, so I put 5 star ratings to this. I also recommend this company to my friend, her name is athya I recommend her to book a ticket in sky picker, because it provide the cheapest flight and also good service in way to pleasent to consument. \\r\\nThere\\'s a lot of travel agent website. But the only thing that keeps in my mind, I love sky picker and no other travel website could replace sky picker in my heart.\\nJenson has a lot of eye catching bike accessories.  Accessories that, perhaps, you had not considered before spotting them on the website.  Such was my experience.  I visited the site expecting to purchase tire tubes and a tube repair kit.

When they ship bad parts, they contest and challenge you from the beginning, and make it hard to get a claim. Not what you want to go through...avoid them at all costs.\\nCalled several days before departure date & spoke to Leslie to request pick up @ 11 am on 3/30/18 instead of noon.  Was told that wouldn\\'t be a problem -  van wasn\\'t ready.  We had to wait for it to be cleaned. The guy cleaning the van was clearly upset and complaining about being asked to clean it!  You could hear everything he was yelling about as he threw things in the back room, while complaining Leslie had asked him to clean it. Needless to say, the van was not cleaned to our expectations (carpet not vacuumed, and outside a mess).  For a 2018 GMC the van was a terrible ride!!  Not near enough cup holders for a 12 seater, and it had so many rattles the trip was miserable.  Some customer service training might be beneficial for AVR as Leslie was short and rude with a room full of customers waiting.  Will not rent from AVR again.  Over priced for what we got.  Would not recommend at all.  Will drive two vehicles next time.  TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE from pick up to drop off!  Can I get a REFUND?  No recommendation from me.\\nI called trying to locate a can dog food that the formula had recently changed. They were able to provide me with the original formula. Chris was very helpful in checking to make sure that they indeed had the original one that I was looking for. He even pointed out that it would be cheaper to buy the case. So glad I found this company. Items were shipped out the same day and I received them super fast.\\nI am so disappointed- never again ZARA ! Was on holiday in Glasgow- I bought a dress , and it broke after 1 time wearing it. Called Zara, and got an unusable answer- that I had to return it in Glasgow again - IWASV ON HOLIDAY; FOR GOD SAKE ! I asked whether I could send it then - BUT NO , I had to return it physically- this is very bad customer service- if you can call this service.\\nTerrible customer service!!!!!!  If you have a problem with your booking, the customer service phone numbers do not reach a person.  They route you back to the website, which ONLY OFFERS you the ability to send an EMAIL to the company.  So in reality, there is NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.\\nThe website is incredibly simple to navigate and the lettering tools allowed me to be creative with the marketing message I needed to represent.

I like this site. Sales and sometimes giveaways.\\nGood company and overall a fast and painless experience.

I sugest it for everyone!\\nWhat can I happily not say! \\n\\nOver the years I\\'ve taught classes and became a tiny business Jewellery maker of Soul Sweet Beads.

I just recently bought packages of birthday card, and children\\'s birthday cards, as I sent birthday greeting to the children in my church.  There were 24 cards, but 8 of them were for granddaughter and grandson, which I couldn\\'t use.  When I called the representative was extremely helpful, and sent me a $5 saving voucher.  I appreciate the gesture and would recommend Walter Drake to everyone.\\nOur install was quick and conveneint thank you to our technician for his kindness and patience with our son.\\nrenting a car can not be easier\\nDriver and attendant were very professional, courteous and reliable.\\nand this was in the middle of night both ways.

What more can you ask for?\\nI will purchase keys from this site at anytime, i\\'M satisfied of the price and safe transaction !!\\nRemarkably quick turnaround. Beautiful work.  Just what we were looking for.\\nI shipped clubs both ways from FL to AZ.  First leg arrived on time at my hotel, but hotel staff couldn\\'t locate clubs because package was left at the purchasing dept. and none of the front desk personnel were aware that it was there.  After an hour of searching, the clubs were located.  I needed to ship clubs back on Fri afternoon, after the UPS pickup time at my hotel so Shipsticks recommended I take to a local UPS store.  Shipsticks emailed me a shipping label for Fedex however, which the local UPS store wouldn\\'t accept, so I had to drive another 20 mins to a Fedex location.  The clubs arrived on time back in FL, but this process was more hassle than I anticipated.\\nMy experience is very good\\nI placed a $200 order on Wednesday May 27th. I paid $30 for the fastest shipping option available. That would mean that my items would arrive around Monday June 1st (today) and Tuesday June 2nd. I checked UPS today and my items hadn\\'t even been shipped. I called UPS. Guess what they said? THEY HADN\\'T EVEN RECEIVED THE ITEMS FROM CORSET STORY YET. Corset Story had generated 2 tracking numbers for my items on Friday May 29th, and yet here we are at 6 p.m. Texas time on Monday June 1st...and my items haven\\'t even been sent to UPS yet. I have sent TWO emails to them today. The first to the Order Enquiry department at around noon-1 p.m. my time, and a second email to the Complaints department at around 3 p.m. I then private messaged them on Facebook and sent a Tweet to them on Twitter. I have not heard a single word back from them. UPS told me today that if they did not receive the packages by end of business today, they would not be able to get my items to me by Thursday June 4th (which is when I MUST have them because I\\'m going out of town that day). So, as of this moment, I am screwed out of receiving my clothing and wasted $200 on this, unless these people actually have souls and will refund me my FULL amount given this massive inconvenience. Or, if I don\\'t get my money back, I will just file a formal complaint with the business in the UK that handles fraudulent transactions and false advertisement.\\nHighly recommended!\\nI ordered on 4/27 and today 5/15 in shipped on 5/13 a little strange to ship on a Sunday, I wish I would have got the e-mail that it had shipped. Not to happy with this order to say the least.\\nI have never heard of JustFly before, so I was really surprised at how easy the website would use. I would definitely recommend to friends.\\ngreat experience\\nThey dont give me my money not even winnings i dont talk about winnings.\\n\\ni dont care about site and maybe about design but when i play there long time back i got stolen money and this is very bad its not  gud\\nI wish there was a couple more functionalities from the user side. Evite sends reminders 3 days before the event. If that was sent out, I didn\\'t get one as the host, which i find to be weird.They also send an RSVP update. I didn\\'t like that I had to pay over 10 invites, it should be 20.\\nThis is everything you need from a VPN for a very good price. The VPN protects from snooping law firms, it unblocks Youtube here in Germany, or the BBC iPlayer. Never tested Hulu or Netflix, not a fan. I choose this service because they promise that they do not log the activities/connections of their users. That is the most important point.\\nOn time. Perfect service\\nLove the products just wish things were in stock more often so i dont have to order bulk ! \\r\\nGreat prices and great delivery !\\nLabels turned out great and were easy to work with...about 30 minutes to do 50.\\nWorse service ever never did my case just got my money.\\nI felt ripped.\\nI will never recommend  to anybody.\\nI ordered bracelets with text. I received a proof in a format I couldn\\'t open and they sent me a PDF right away. Once I approved that, the bracelets were manufactured and shipped right away. I ordered 75 and received over 80 bracelets. i would order from this company again. I have also referred others to them for bracelets as well. Lots of choices.\\nLoved working with Premier Lighting!

Thank you!\\nI spoke with Chris who was knowledgeable and professional. It was a pleasure to do business with him.\\nGreat packaging\\nI ordered e-cards as I was in a time crunch and the site said orders would be available within 24 hours.  However, the site did not say that orders would be sent ONCE VERIFIED BY PHONE and it took 2 days for me to actually talk to someone before the vouchers were sent.  Every time I called the number noted in the email, I rec\\'d a recording saying all representatives were busy and someone would call me back.  We played phone tag (as I was at work during the day and am not allowed personal calls) for 48 hours which delayed my delivery.   The gift cards were for a basket for Nurse\\'s Week and we almost did not make the deadline---which we easily would have made if the vouchers had been sent as promised.  I still do not understand the \"verification\" process; they wanted my name, address and charge card---information that I had already provided.  I appreciated the discount on the cards, but it was not as easy getting the cards as advertised.\\nGood Service and good people\\nI love the information that 1000Bulbs provides - and a wide variety of LED chandelier bulbs that actually look beautiful.\\nPhoto book\\nReceived order within the expected delivery time.  Very nice quality of book and of the pictures.\\nI trust this company because they test all their products and include the test results with the product they ship. Their shipping is extremely fast too.\\nI am going on a cruise and as a lap-band person I need my protein shakes.  The sample packages make it easy to transport multiple flavors.  I am taking some brands/flavors I have had before, but I also added some new stuff to try.\\nAlways good service the manager is is a stand up guy\\nFrom the first phone call I made to inquire about ADT through out the entire process of installation completion, the services were excellent.\\nMy name is Claire Gravell and I purchased this course on Groupon. Being a bit skeptical of doing an online course, it was very easy to use and if you had any trouble there is an online chat that is instant in answering any questions. I learned what I needed to and very impressed with how things were handled!\\nIt is exactly what I wanted\\nTruly one of the worst companies on the internet...customer service is customer disservice...their coupons are typically of the bait and switch nature....preferred shipping, for which the consumer pays more, is anything but...STAY AWAY!\\nNice resist flag\\nGood to buy USA made\\nRESIST trump\\nHidden fees, inconvenient unit, but it\\'s fine\\nI ordered a candy I\\'ve been wanting for years. When I ordered it the site said they had 2 left in stock. A few weeks later I\\'m notified that my order was canceled cause the item was no longer in stock. They never took their money which is good, but I was disappointed that I didn\\'t get my item when it\\'s very hard to find.\\nI love Thrift Books.  Great selection.  Easy ordering.  Quick delivery.\\nI liked the BOATERexam course for it short units, with video clips and diagrams. It was easy to sign up, log in and out as needed and complete the test. I ran into no technical difficulties. The provider was good enough to provide me with reminders about completing the course units (though not in the sense of overloading my inbox with junk mail). I had never grown up with knowledge of marine culture yet I was able to access the information without difficulty.\\nI ordered an entire series by a single author that consisted of 16 books from Thrift Books. The order process was very straightforward and worked flawlessly. The books were incredibly reasonably priced, most were in new condition, and even the used ones were in better condition than most books at the library. They all came on time or early and were packaged very well. I\\'m extremely happy with Thrift Books and would recommend them to everyone.\\nBest price, nice product and fast shipping. All the services are very good, including customer care.\\nThe best thank you\\nI\\'ve bought, sold, and rented books from Bookbyte over the past two years with good results. My most recent order of a used book with expedited shipping arrived promptly and looked new! Their website is well organized and their prices are competitive. I have found Bookbyte to be a trustworthy and reliable vendor.\\nI ordered a lawn sign to recognize my wife\\'s retirement. The product I purchased was professionally done and arrived on time. I was very pleased\\nThe Zaggora prints are funky and fun and although the pants did not work for me, my experience with the team at Zaggora was completely positive.  I called at about 10pm on a Tuesday night and left a voice mail message which I thought would be heard in the morning and they would call me as I gave them my cell phone number.  Instead I woke up to an email as to how to return the items....what a concept \"customer service on the highest level\"...Wonderful to work with such a company with complete work ethics for the consumer, and rare find these days\\nI found quality refills here for half the price of brand name. The shipping was cheap and timely. 5 stars.\\nI have been buying from this website for several years. The prices are unbeatable and the service has always been excellent! I hope they never change their business model.\\nSlow delivery ,brake \\r\\n pads worked fine but got the wrong transistor, not fault on your part, I hit the wrong one when ordered\\nI\\'ve had these for years and love them.\\nI screwed up my order and was promptly notified about it. I received my order very quickly and with free shipping. They threw in a free grinder and vac seal container. These guys are great.\\nOK, I\\'m guilty.  I made the decision to switch all my domains from the other guy and come here.  All to save a couple bucks.  Big mistake.  My bad.  This hosting company is awful from the top down.  Nobody knows how to fix the even the most basic issues like billing.  You send them an email.  No response.  Then you call.  They place you on hold.  And explain in great detail the problem and they send you to another.  There help thingy on their web site is so out of date is not funny.  db operate on mysqli functionally which has been around FOR TWO YEARS!!!.  They don\\'t not have correct or current software to process this code.\\r\\n  Hey, if you have like one little site you might be OK.  But I truly don\\'t think they can handle even just one hosted domain.  The staff on the phone doesn\\'t even know how to work there own system!!.   It\\'s like the lights in the entire building got turned off and they\\'re just sitting in the dark.  Ummm.  OK,  there are plenty of hosting companies  out there that could serve your needs more effective other than H.G.  don\\'t think your gonna save money with these guys.  You will not.  \\r\\nI do not recommend H.G. \\r\\nI will be moving my domains from there server.\\r\\nGood luck\\nI have purchased casement window hardware from Hardware Source on a couple of occasions.  They always have the brand that I need and fill the order quickly and easily.  They are my go-to source when I need hardware for our windows.\\nExtra money back and a quicker/seamless process unlike the one offered on behalf of the retail store.\\nLess than perfect\\r\\nThe wreath was not as full and beautiful as the picture and for the money did not meet expectations\\nservice was prompt, accurate and as promised.\\nBest price I could find for what I bought, and I shop pretty hard when I am buying online. I would give 5 stars except there was no shipment notification or tracking information given.  A week after ordering, I had to call to check on my order, was told it would ship that day or the next, and it then arrived the following day. (I selected regular ground shipping, so didn\\'t expect it to arrive much sooner than that but since it was a business purchase, needed to know when to expect it.) Also, item apparently drop shipped from mfr, (if that was noted on the listing I didn\\'t see it) which I would have liked to have known as that usually adds to shipping time. They did not tell me that when I called, either.  That said, I received my items by the time I needed and was very pleased with them. Will definitely shop with them in the future.\\nI Book a ticket from New York to Frankfort and after 2 minutes I have a electronic ticket\\nPretty straight forward airline, got us from A-B with no issues.\\n\\nVueling allowed my friends to check in their hand luggage for free, whilst I previously paid for mine checking in on their website, this was a nice unexpected touch for my friends so cant complain.\\nWebsite easy to use and the flowers are beautifully packaged and delivered as scheduled!\\nEXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL WEB SITE, EASY ORDERING EXPERIENCE\\ngood experience.\\nGreg and Jamye did a great job on my loan even though it was out of state.  Fast Professional and personal.   Would recommend this team to anyone looking\\nAfter my local eye doctor gave me an eye exam and handed me a copy of the prescription, I chose frames that would take 2-3 weeks to arrive.  Then I went to Global Eyeglasses and ordered 2 pair of inexpensive glasses with my new prescription.  In less than 2 weeks, a small box from Global Eyeglasses arrived in my mailbox with both pairs, well packaged and well-made.  I\\'ve since ordered several more pairs from Global Eyeglasses. Now I have a decent collection of glasses to accessorize with (and have as backups) for less than the cost of some of the pricey individual frames I saw at the local eye doctor\\'s office.  There\\'s just no reason for expensive glasses.\\nI am extremely impressed with the care put into my order.\\nI brought some headphones from this company and so far they seem like good quality.

Do not trust this company.\"\\n\\nWell I informed Rentalcars.com that \"My Terms and conditions\" are very clear and aren\\'t written in very small letters and they say: \"Never make the same mistake again!\"\\n\\nThey have lost a customer because of the untrue and misleading information published on their website.\\nAfter signing up with $149 website I was informed in 5 days my business website would be ready and on the 4th day the website was ready and now I am working on the fine tuning.\\nVery impressive work \\n\\nThanks so much\\nVery very happy with R&G Brenner tax service. Peter Pascarelli was the shining star. He has been doing my taxes for 5+ years. He helped me tremendously with getting credit for my repairs that were done during Hurricane Sandy. I highly recommend him to anybody that needs a tax specialist. \\n\\nThanks again,\\nErol Fettahlioglu\\nI LIKE THE PRODUCT BUT I THINK IT IS COSTLY AND THE SHIPMENT IS TOO SLOW.\\nI never received my order....\\nExcellent, definitely set my truck off👌\\nGreat deal also.\\nI have been very pleased with the products. They arrive when promised and function as advertised. The prices are competitive and product line diverse. I would recommend this company.\\nEasy site to use, found location and cars easy, booking went fine. Thanks!\\nI sent goods back to seller, but have never received refund from seller. So I escalated to PayPal, I provided all evidence to prove that seller has received my returned goods, but unfortunately PayPal keep telling me that they couldn\\'t verify the product has sent to the seller, so denied me and closed my case. I lose $2400,  but they take it like it\\'s no big deal. Their Customer service sucks , and remember they don\\'t fight for you, or protect you at all. Stay away if you don\\'t want to be the next victim.\\nHave used Global parking many times very happy with the service.\\nWill reserve for the being.\\nEasy to buy from. Shipping was fast. Contacts as advertised.\\nReceived the exact item I ordered with fast delivery!\\nif you are looking for a place to store your belongings,  try Public Storage they are very accommadating.\\nI recommend that everyone sign up for Goldstar!  It\\'s wonderful being able to attend so many shows at a great discount.  Being a Red Velvet member has enabled me to get the best seats at a great price...so glad a friend recommended Goldstar to me. Join now!!\\nQuality product at the right price.  And fast shipping too.\\nreally fast shipping great prices too\\nTHE WEBSITE IS VERY SLOW AND ACTUALLY CHECKING OUT IS A VERY FRUSTRATING PROCESS LATELY.\\nSite was easy to use but a little difficult to figure out the prices. It shows one rate at first and then a higher rate at checkout that doesn\\'t add up even after concidering the trip insurance fee. ??\\nMel was so helpful and considerate and took extra time to help get me a discount on the cancellation fee.\\nOur Progressive Dinner team building event was fantastic.  It was not exactly what we had planned due to the fact that the restaurant said it would be too difficult for the waiters to serve the dinner if we moved around. However, the facilitator and his assistants did a fantastic job in adjusting the activity and kept all of us right on time.  The activities they had for us were a lot of fun and very engaging for the entire group.  This group is very competitive, so that made it even that much better.  There was lots of laughter all evening.\\nI paid and they did not deliver 2.000.000 coins for fifa 15.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOrder number: 12543141\\r\\nDate of order: Wednesday, 08.

Very fast delivery.\\nLost my saab keys.  They cut a key to my key code for me and the communication with them was great since I had mistakenly provided the incorrect key code at first and also had split the order into two orders one being the key the other the cutting service.  Thanks for saving me money and getting me driving again!\\nThey were good. Very patient when it came Down to show how to activate the alarm. Now I have to member to show my wife how it works. They\\'re were cool. Mr. Thomas and his apprentice.\\nQuick and simple!!!\\nThese people are theives. My game would not work and their support is useless and they refuse to issue a refund.\\nAll as promised and well packed. Thanks!\\nVery nice slides. They are really comfy after long runs. They do get a little sweaty in the arches for me, but it could just be me. It keeps me from wearing them casually.\\nVery transparent. Accessible and easy use.\\nI was looking for a flight, looked into different pages that do the same thing comparing prices. JustFly got the best deal for price + flight times. I will be using this page again when in need of flight tickets.\\nfast shipping. great product\\nI asked for I was not treated with respect and concern when I asked for a sample replacement, so I place a $3,000. with another company. Thank!!!\\nadored using priceline. Was just so simple. Got an amazing price and check in was a breeze. Would definitely use it again.\\nVery unhappy with this rental start to finish. I voiced my concerns when I dropped the car off but nothing was done. I’ve exclusively rented from you guys the last several years but I will be looking to other companies for my next rental.\\nvery trust worthy!\\nI love TopCashBack! It\\'s so easy to receive payment by just going through the website. I online shop anyway so this site is perfect. I\\'ve also come across new websites I hadn\\'t shopped on before with great sales. \\nOnly cons- It takes a bit for processing to receive the payment. Other than that, it\\'s great!\\nI had no problem ordering my two rugs, but there are no instructions as to how to return them, and they do not come with a packing slip of any kind.  I had to call Customer Service and get an RA (return authorization number), and then mark my package with it.  Even then they said they\\'d email me the RA#, I never got an e-.  Fortunately, I took the number down immediately, as the rep spoke.  And I included a printout of my order, just so RD knew whose order it was.  They seem a little unenthusiastic and deliberately uninformative about returns.  My other issue is that the rug color on screen is nowhere close to the actual rug color, or even the description.  The \"cream\" background of the rug on screen and in the description turned out to be a true tan.  RD needs to do a little better with its color resolution on its website AND in he rug description.\\nI am not recive any call from your side and not getting any update about my refund regarding my booking 3599918461\\nI\\'ve been buying stuff from them for over two years, I\\'ve never had a single issue.  The clothes are stylish, and a couple times a year they have a huge clearance sale.  Jack Threads is one of the 4-5 stores I shop from online to get all my clothes.  Can\\'t go wrong with them!\\nWhile I like the service, it is very convenient, I did not like the fact that I could not use my groupon for the parking over this past weekend.\\nI am moving out of state soon and have packed many of my belongings in anticipation of this move.  The boxes are in a storage facility with no easy access until my house sells.  I needed/wanted to cook a special dinner for friends but one of my favorite cookbooks was in storage.  I went online to Thriftbooks, found the cookbook ordered it and received in just a few days.  My guests were happy with the meal I prepared and I was happy to entertain my guests.  The easy access, large selection, reasonable price and quick responsiveness of Thrift-books facilitated this successful dinner party to help me ay goodbye and thank you to some valuable friends.\\nEasy to order on the website.  Lots of great info about the products, with links to other sources too, so helpful when making a decision as to whether a particular product is right for you.  Easy to track parcel and delivered quickly.  Have used before and also great service then. A business it is safe to trust.  One of my favourites.\\nThis web site was easy to maneuver and gave information you requested.\\nI use PureFormulas to purchase supplements that are hard to find.  They always have them and deliver quickly and for FREE!  The best part of using PureFormulas???  They are so much cheaper than purchasing the same brand of supplements from my Naturepath doctor.\\nLang wall calendars are superior in quality and artwork. Instead of hanging a calendar, you are complementing the artwork already in your home.  \\nWe live on a large lake in northern Minnesota and prefer calendars that blend into our environment, whether the four different seasons, lakes, terrains, plants, etc. or the neighbors we live with (bear, moose, deer, fish,etc).\\nCheapest ticket online!\\nVery helpful customer service and great products.\\nThe site is easy and works perfectly\\nBuyers lender failed to verify buyers education loan status causing 3 week delay in closing. Sellers could not receive any money for this delay as buyers loan would be in jeopardy. Sellers are out 3 weeks of mortgage/taxes/insurance. WE SHOULD HAVE SOLD THE HOME TO OTHER BUYERS.\\nThe lady who took my reservation was extremely nice and helpful.\\nI placed an order the end of December. I received an email telling me the product was back ordered, but I did not receive an anticipated date of when it would arrive. I sent an email to the provided customer service email address and it took a week to receive a reply. When I did receive the reply it was missing words, which made it difficult to understand, and looked very unprofessional.\\r\\nI was given a date as to when a new shipment would arrive. When this day came and went, I sent an email inquiring about my order and if the shipment had been received. I never got a reply. So I called. I was then given a date a couple weeks away. When that date came and went I called again. I was told that the item had arrived (why was I not contacted?) and because it had been over 30 days since my original order, it would have to be re-ordered. So we did that, and as the customer service rep was about to hang up, I asked if the original payment was still able to be used. He checked, and sure enough, needed the info again since it had been so long. \"Good thing you said something,\" he replied. \\r\\nI received the item a few days later, and I was very excited since by this time I had been waiting for 7 weeks. My excitement turned to extreme frustration when I opened the box and found that somebody else\\'s name was engraved on it! I had to call three times to get through and explain the situation to yet another customer service rep. I am now waiting - again - for a new one to be sent to me with MY name engraved on it, as well as a return shipping label to send back the one I received. \\r\\nSo I am now at over 7 weeks and have not received the item I ordered.\\r\\nEXTREMELY frustrating. I would never recommend this company.\\nProduct good shipping a little slow.\\nReceived part when I was supposed to,good part at a reasonable price.\\nGreat company. Excellent service. From the first notification ,through the delivery. Five Star Company.\\nSecurely buy or sell bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies with no stress or fear at furcoins That is where I trade bitcoins\\nEasy, helpful and fast.\\nFound my part easily on the website, the ordering process was efficient, and I received it in the promised time!\\nI love my 65 inch ultra high-definition television. It came shipped from FedEx and I was really afraid that it may have some cracks or something like that but it was perfectly safe and sound packaged really nice. And I just love the experience thank you so much Buydig\\nI have tried to get the attention of the company to report that the order I was charged for, was not complete. I have received no response. I won\\'t order from this company again.\\nI\\'d give EO 5 stars except that they\\'re going out of business so the selection is rather limited.  Also, I am pretty upset that EO will soon be no more.  It has been my go-to vendor for optics and birding gear for myself and for recommending to others since I started birding in 2003.  So sorry you\\'re closing up shop.  My best to all at EO in your future endeavors.\\nFirst time using PetFlow.com and I\\'m really happy with their product selection and prices.\\nI like the fact that you have a large selection to choose from; that is very important for a bodybuilder.\\nMy Rep Dan was fantastic!! He listened to my needs and was very responsive to them. He price matched without hesitation. This was truly a great experience. This is my 3rd car I\\'ve brought here in the past 3 months and I\\'ll come here moving forward with all my tireviews needs.\\ntold i was getting a fire alarm included and didnt get it, wasnt informed that i would receive a sales pitch for lots of expensive extras, installed was schedule for 8am and showed up around 730, install took 3 hours and i could have done it in 30 minutes, installer also informed me of another hidden fee for a city permit, installed did not have all of the necessary equipment. both the agent and installer were nice and customer service oriented so this must be an issue with your company\\'s procesures. i would not recommend to others at this point. not happy. looking to ship around within my 30 day trial the agent and the installer said i had. \\nmaldonado 915.309.4002\\nThey Have been there when I needed them,thanks.\\nWu is an honest exchanger\\nHonest description of item and fast shipping....\\nThe flowers always arrive so fresh. So nice my husband got this for me, I absolutely love it!\\nThe person taking my order was friendly and very helpful, and the delivery was as promised.\\nRight at your fingure tips\\nGood experience overall with my first order, but the competitive price entry (5% off) vs free shipping options (add items that allow a credit for shipping) is a little confusing at first. Comparable prices to competition, but at least for the products I bought, (Optimum Nutrition - various natural protein powders), they seem to have decent prices on all items as opposed to some sites which have 1 or 2 items low priced (loss leaders), and then the rest at high prices. I can\\'t review the order fulfillment and delivery portion of their service, because I just placed the order.\\nVery good tshirts\\nI needed some replacement bulbs and found your website very friendly and easy to use. Would recommend to friends searching for bulbs. \\nThank you.\\nexcellent service....\\nNice framing and great prices!\\nI bought the \"Executive Package\" because I really wanted a resume that helped me stand out, both on paper and online.  The reviews were awesome (now I\\'m wondering if they were faked, I guess I will find out when I see if this is ever posted), so I decided to go for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey took my existing resume and basically put it in a template - no rewording, no optimizing of key words -- in fact the few keywords they added were not keywords used in my industry or the job I wanted to go for.\\r\\n\\r\\nVERY disappointed to say the least.  After receiving my first and second drafts, I asked that I be bumped down to the $99 service since I lost all faith and really didn\\'t want them touching my LinkedIn profile based on the quality I was seeing, and the first draft cover letter they formed was useless.  They promptly replied, \"sorry no refunds, and no discounts\" - even though I have no plans for them to complete the services included in the package.  So now I\\'m stuck paying for something I didn\\'t get.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy advice?  Look up some nice templates online (that is all they will really do for you) and some basic resume tips and tricks (i.e. keep it to 1 to 2 pages)... these are all FREE and readily available online.  There is no \"professional writing\" and keyword optimization based on ANY (my writer admitted she had none) industry knowledge you are targeting or even for the job you are wanting.\\nThis site has great prices and if you are on their email list, you frequently get free shipping on any priced order, at almost every holiday.  All sorts of gadgets and As Seen on TV products.\\nCheapOAIR has been great to me on making flights and hotel reservations also very helpful if your plans change need  change dates   I have  had pleasant experience with everyone I talk to  thank you\\nThe tank top was supposed to be 9.99\\nThe versatile sport bra was also from VIP section for 9.99 however I was charged quite a bit more\\nOverall experience with Personal Comfort has been great! Customer service is awesome!  We love our new bed.  The only issue we had was with delivery and set up.  The delivery guys did not set up the bed correctly and argued about removing the old mattress when we paid to have the old one removed.  We contacted customer service and the issue was resolved immediately.  Other than that, we are very pleased with our purchase!  I would definitely recommend this company to others.\\nSeamless transaction\\nI ordered a set - ballpoint, rollerball and fountain pen two weeks ago and paid for a more expedited shipping timeframe.  After several days I was advised that only the ballpoint would ship as the rest was out of stock - the remainder would be shipped upon receipt when they received their next shipment in seven days.  I called after 8 days and they said their order was delayed another week.  Surprised they didn\\'t email me as soon as they learned they didn\\'t receive their shipment.  Really surprised that no one offered to refund what I\\'d paid for expedited shipping.  At this point all I can do is wait as they already have my money\\nI absolutely loved the material and design!\\nTimely delivery, well packed, directions were adequate, and merchandise was high quality.\\nI am having trouble getting specifically contract/part time opportunities.\\nOne  of the best companies I\\'ve had dealt with ever . I highly recommend them.\\nMarketview Liquor\\'s website offers a terrific selection. My favorite is to check the \"Deal of the Day\" where I\\'ve been lucky enough to find very good red wine at under $7 a bottle. If you order 6, the shipping is free. Not only is it free, but the wine arrives the very next day. How could this get any better?\\nI am very happy with my purchase\\nThis service is designed for people like me. .who are maybe too spontaneous or, on the other hand, too much of a procrastinator.  Either way, I found myself with a departure date looming ahead and no passport.  RushMyPassport walked me carefully and meticulously through the whole process. . never abandoning me. . and got my passport back to me even sooner than they guaranteed!  Now all I have to do is pack, get to the airport on time, and enjoy my trip!  Thank you RushMyPassport!\\nLove Love Love my two air ferns! Just as described, fast ship, arrived in perfect condition! This is the only place I could find the air ferns! I remember them from growing up in the 70\\'s. They are fantastic! Reliable company! Order them already!! Just ordered 4 more!\\nThank you so much. The pens look amazing. I almost don\\'t want to hand them. Looking forward to ordering with you guys again.\\nParts arrived on time and worked perfect.\\nWould definitely use them again.\\nI was at the location in Norcross on and off trying to find the right unit for myself and my needs. I met with the same young girl every time. I\\'m not too good with names or remembering them but she was great! I should have remembered the name. Never the less, she was awesome with a great joking and professional personality which is great when you\\'re working with people....you always need a good laugh. She made great suggestions and answered all my off the wall need to know it all questions with confidence and professionalism. I believe this girl needs a round of applause! I\\'ve never had such great customer service. Way to go Securcare on choosing a great team and person to run the store. Office looked good and smelled great. You have my recommendation 100%. Thank you.\\nFast and easy. Just like it always is.\\nHad a minor issue, was contacted immediately by a representative to took care of the issue.  Very happy with end result.\\nRewind of the Shoals played at my daughter\\'s wedding couldn\\'t have asked for a better performance. It was a outdoor event on a farm Not only did they listen to what we were needed done they went beyond. The music they play is for everyone.

Sincerely, Emmanuel Silva\\nClean place, friendly staff, offered better deal than other places I enquired for a whole package of services. Using laser away for hair removal and clear and brillant facial.\\nEasy booking\\nI have been ordering Lang products for years.  I used to live close to a store that carried the calendars but I moved so now I order online.  I have never had a problem with any of the products and they are A1.  The calendars are perfection and pictures worth saving once the year has passed.  I would recommend Lang to everyone.\\na lot more choices for plus size online\\nPart arrived quickly and was exactly what was needed. Price was good and made the repairs without the hassle of shop labor draining my wallet, I never did much electrical work before, but the right part helped make it easy.\\nI wasn\\'t given the 10% I was offered for signing up.\\nYou have to check out the place once you buy items you\\'ll buy items for life\\nI have 6 dogs and 2 cats. I live out in the country and a distance from good places to buy animal foods. To drive such a distance, (with today\\'s gas prices), lug heavy bags, as well as just the time involved makes petflow.com perfect for me. The times that I have had to call, I have also been impressed with their customer service. I\\'m very pleased to be a loyal customer of theirs.\\nlove these individual snack bags!!\\nIt was a great experience. Almost every topic required is covered in this course. This gave me confidence to hit the road.\\nI found 1-800-DENTIST on an AARP website.  I was looking for info about dentists in my area and their prices.  1-88-DENTIST transferred me immediately to a dentist that wanted to sign me up  immediately for a checkup at a new patient bargain price.  Upon further inquiry I discovered they were the same price as my present dentist.  All I really wanted were names and approximate price lists for dentists in my area not a new dentist ready to sign me up as a patient immediately.  I did not like nor want the pressure.  Won\\'t use this site again nor will recommend it to anyone.\\nWe experienced great customer service from Debbie. I would definitely recommend this site to a friend!\\nIt\\'s always a pleasure to order from Queesboro. The sale prices can\\'t be beat, the quality of the products is superb, and the delivery is always fast. The customer service has always been professional and helpful when I have contacted them with questions. Five stars for sure!\\nFirst, I was treated professionally while ordering. Another highlight for me, and why I will be a return customer, is because the customer service representative searched for and redeemed a coupon code for my purchase.

Will definitely order again.\\nWhen it comes to purchasing items from Reeds, I\\'ve been very happy....as long as I purchase in the store.  I made an expensive purchase for Valentine\\'s online and was horribly disappointed.  My order arrived and fell apart right out of the box.  I was devastated.  Luckily, we were able to return it and exchange it at our local store.  I don\\'t think I will risk ordering anything else from Reed\\'s online.  I\\'ll just stick with purchasing in store.\\nCheap bundles, instant key delivery, never had a problem with any purchases.\\nPaul Lorilla has always been extremely helpful as we also place our orders with him.

Everyone I communicated with at Eagle Optics knew the products inside and out and were able to give me valuable information and recommendations to help me select the best product for my intended use.  Just a great experience overall in every respect.  I could have made my binocular purchase from Cabella\\'s, Bass Pro Shop, Sportsman\\'s Warehouse, etc., but specifically purchased from Eagle Optics because of their superior product knowledge and incredible customer service ethic.  Eagle Optics earned and deserved my business.\\nEasy and simple make perfect.\\nFirst time using ink farm. I had a great experience!!! Love this site!\\nI work for a general contractor and we were preparing some marketing materials for an upcoming conference, and knew we needed something to give to potential clients.  We found Flashbay online and contacted them about helping us.  They had several products to choose from, along with assigning Ryan Joyal to help us through this process.  Ryan was great and provided great communication and a quick turn around.  We selected the product, submitted the artwork and what we wanted printed (we went with 16gb jump drives).  Ryan quickly prepared a draft for approval and was able to begin having the order processed.  We started process on a Thursday morning, approval by early afternoon, payment in the afternoon (was real easy to submit payment), and I received the product by Tuesday the following week, which was pretty good in my opinion, especially over a holiday weekend.  This was a fast, easy, and pleasant transaction.  Ryan\\'s communication and support was great.  We will definitely look to Ryan and Flashbay for our future needs.\\r\\nThank you,\\r\\nLeo Hanley\\nAmit work hard to ensure my program was correctly installed and ensured i understood how the program work .

Thanks guys.\\nThe train left  Helsinki on time and arrived in St Petersburg on time also. The service on board was friendly and efficient. The currency officer and border officials were also efficient.\\nStaff is really pleasant, and they know my name.

No complaints, excellent service.. Hands Down, an awesome store..\\nY\\'all have worked so fast on my account. Results are amazing!!!\\nI found the hardware device needed quickly and at a reasonable price. When it was received it was as advertised and installed routinely\\nMy experience with thrift books has been good. The only thing that can be improved on is the shipping of items. They offer free shipping on $10 or more orders and that\\'s great because the prices of the items are very reasonable.  I think if the items are shipped and received with a turn around time of two days it would be even greater. But I will continue to return. I\\'ve mentioned this website to other friends. \\n\\nHonest Maddy\\nWas told that the provider accepted my insurance. Not accurate. Also did. It actually help me talk to someone just got me a number to call. I\\'m not really sure what this service is even for. Please forget my email.\\nEverything was smooth and easy.

And the App very easy to use!!  Love it.\\nBEST FLIGHTS FOR THE BEST PRICES.\\nAnswered all of my questions were clean and timely\\nThe items that I received were of high quality with a fair price. I will definitely use this supplier for future beekeeping needs.\\nMade an online reservation.  A week later I get a cancellation out of the blue.  The explanation is that the facility \"has requested to put a hold on reservations\", whatever that means.  Good thing it didnt happen the day before I was supposed to arrive.I was offered a $5 off coupon for my trouble.  An appropriate response would be to reimburse me the difference between what it will cost me now and the prepaid amount I originally contracted.  No.  None of that.  Company is probably run by a bunch of 20 somethings who have never been taught the concept of accountability.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nAs you can see, their response shows either no understanding of the issue or a terribly flawed business model.  \\n\\nThe issue is that your system indicated parking availability.  When a reservation, made a week earlier became inconveient, it was cancelled.  When that occurs, ParkWhiz should do right by their customer.\\n\\nThe other possibility is that ParkWhiz, has no clue as to the availability of parking with the vendors they represent.  Parking may or may not be available and always subject to a last minute cancellation.\\n\\nThe moral of the story: Deal with ParkWhiz and \"Hold Your Breath\", you may or may not have a place to park.\\nFast pick up from airport. Friendly customer service.\\nHad a great experience. No problems, gave me the price quoted and mailed the check out quickly. Thank you!\\nI consider tripadvisor as my first go-to resource when planning vacations.  I love the helpful reviews and member photos.  I often receive helpful tips on which rooms to request or which entrees are not to be missed.  I never hesitate to trust tripadvisor reviews for restaurants although I am beginning to have to exercise more caution when considering accommodation and activity reviews.  If a reviewer has many posts and previous reviews, I will trust them.  But often I am finding that a near-the-top-ranked  hotel or tour company, for example, might have MANY reviews that seem questionable.  The reviewer only has 1 or 2 previous reviews and maybe no (or 1-2) forum posts and says generic things.  If I see too many of this type of review for an establishment, I don\\'t trust their ranking. It makes me question whether or not they are paying people to write reviews for them (I\\'ve read that reviews can be \"bought\").  So, all in all, I still view tripadvisor to be a valuable resource but at time I am suspicious of the authenticity of some of the reviews.\\nMy two orders came earlier than the stated dates.  Thanks!!!\\nI would recommend you to take a chance of trusting yourself by using this web .\\nThe best survey site I\\'ve been on. Surveys come at a good pace,rules for getting compensation are clear and when levels are reached for payment it is the quickest I\\'ve seen on any site.

I began by going to the shop hoping they could easily help me with 3 different designs, but I ended up wasting 45 mins on each of 2 different trips.  I ended up designing the layout on my own on my laptop.  \\n\\nI was very surprised they don\\'t have software to help with this.  I also suspect that a new employee was working with me, and I think someone more experienced should have noticed that she/we needed help and come to the rescue.\\nDavid handled my case in a very professional and kind mattered. He made a situation that has been bother me possible to overcome and made me feel okay with taking steps to resolve my financial situation.

We left with an empty gas tank, the finance deparment didn\\'t hold their end of the deal, instead we were basically told we are saving 2000 dollars in the long run and to take the deal or get a higher interest rate.  We had agreed to put 1000 down if they came down 1000 from the price our our vehicle they counteracted and said they would bring down the offer if we put 1210.70. We agreed and in the end they did not hold up their end of the deal or disclose they weren\\'t going to either.\\nI found Vidarjewelry on Etsy the first week of March.  I found the perfect engagement ring for my soon to be fiancé and knew that I had to have it.  I contacted Roi and asked if it was possible to have the stone changed in the ring to an Aquamarine and sure enough it was!  I purchased the ring on March 1 and today, March 11, I received it!  The craftsmanship is stunning and the ring is perfect. Roi worked with me every step of the way from offering ways to size her without her knowing, to shipping options to just keeping me posted on the progress.  Roi was incredibly easy to work with and I could not recommend someone more!  His work is one of a kind and absoultey stunning.  On top of that, there was an appraisal of the ring with it and THE BOX HAS AN LED LIGHT IN IT!! As a theatre professional, that little detail makes me smile and laugh and appreciate the obvious pride he takes in his work.  Thank you Roi and the Vidarjewelry team for making this the best experience I\\'ve had buying jewelry and for making an incredible piece for me! \\n\\nLiz\\nHaven\\'t received my order that was placed 2 weeks ago.\\nFast shipping!\\nBest way to get quick quotes\\nThe website is setup wonderful.

The site is easy to use.\\nI have just spent the last hour trying to log into my \"corset story\" account & contact customer service to request a return without success. I am extremely frustrated hence this review. I have tried calling customer services, using the number listed for  customer service on the website which is unobtainable. I then sent an e-mail to which I got a response advising me to change my password. I have changed my password three times today and am still unable to request a return. As this is the only way to return goods it looks as if I will miss the 14 day dealine within which returns have to be requested. Am beginning to think this is a ploy to prevent goods being returned. First time using this company and I won\\'t be using them again. Can anyone advise alternative means of returning goods to them?\\nQuickcash MI is fantastic! Best place for discounted gift cards!\\nThe purchases I have made are great and delivery times are excellent .

I decided to do a first time try with sunglasses as I have astigmatism and wear progressive lens and I know that there are more dynamics involved with that. I ordered my sunglasses (WileyX) and not only did Frames Direct have the best cost on the frames, they were amazing on the cost of the lens. I went with the best Transition lenses with all the coatings and they beat all my local shops by at least 200.00. I received the glasses in a timeframe stated by Frames Direct and tFrames Direct highly athey are awesome. I went to my local shop to have the frames fitted properly and they verified that the prescription was filled properly. I recommend Frames Direct highly, at least for my long distance non-progressive glasses, as to date that is all I have sampled.\\nThis is the second year in a row I have ordered my fundraiser tickets through them.

They could not fix my outgoing caller ID either. Avoid phone power at all cost.\\nWas looking for lodging at a particular property and reservation counter had an availability when the property\\'s web site said no room at the inn.

This is my favorite coffee mug!\\nEasy to navigate and the most up to date job postings.\\ngood site, fast answer and access\\nThere needs to be a much closer correspondence between the automobiles shown in the AutoEurope car selection menu and the one that\\'s actually offered by the rental companies. I ordered a Mercedes A type with 4 doors and a hatchback, and was offered a Renault Megane with two doors, no luggage space, and a convertible hardtop! Useless!

The pine look has to be looked at a long time before realizing it isn\\'t the real thing.\\nI rented my vehicle months in advance to ensure I had a minivan.  The service was fantastic.  The only negative would be the line up to complete your paper work.  Being that they had the cheapest price on car rentals, everyone seemed to be waiting in line with us.  However once we were done the registration part, everything else was smooth and there was a great selection of cars.  I will definitely rent with them again.\\nGreat quality and fit. Style lasts and fit stays strong! Love these clothes!!!\\nI had not used HomeAdvisor for a number of years but when I was looking for a painter to paint the exterior of my home and not one of our neighbors or friends had a recommendation I turned to HomeAdvisor.

They were absolutely terrific and affordable and I would definitely recommend them to anyone.\\nI have now ordered multiple items form American RV.  I have been satisfied each time by the products received, even the \\'reconditioned\\' one.  When I had an issue with the shipping charges AmRV Customer Service took the time to explain the costs, the breakdowns and why it cost that month.

NOW on our return to a garage with flood lights and a girl who is going over it with a fine touth comb even on her knees under the car surprise she finds a mark under the car. this was not done by us  this is a scam by the company to fleece motorists off their money. they deducted 1100 euros from my card . and when the repair cost is taken from it they will reimburse the rest. luckeIy i purchased extra insurance in the uk .DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY\\nFind one that is not found in other sites\\nSo convinced\\ncompetitive with good customer service; reliable; is the industry pricing correct or a bit high as a result of collusion\\nTreatments are much easier than I thought.

I contacted firmoo and they got back to me in a couple of hours on a weekday which I was impressed by and they helped me exchange my glasses without any issues. They dispatched the glasses with my prescription quickly too which I was also very impressed by as most online stores take atleast 2 weeks.\\n\\nUPDATE: I bought my glasses and has been roughly 2 weeks and my glasses have broken. I am very disappointment in the quality and build. I will not be buying from this company again.

It\\'s a mother and daughter owned store, so you don\\'t get that creepy vibe like a lot of other sex toy sites.

Could not have been easier\\nI\\'ve seen a lot of dating sites such as this one but this is in the top 5.\\nExcellent selection, price and order shipping and handling.  Only thing I ran into is I opted for expedited shipping and had the glasses sent to my office where I spend most days.  I got an email from a customer service rep asking that I write back and say I agree with their shipping policy before they would send the product because they\\'re \\'shipping to a business\\'.  That delayed things and was a bit confusing, never had that happen and I get stuff sent to the office all the time.  But I agreed and the product showed up as expected.  Had to return it as it was too small (my fault, I ordered the wrong size) and so far the return process has been clearly articulated at every step of the way and very smooth.  So one little glitch but overall I\\'m planning on shopping with them again.\\nGood product but the sealant packed loose inside rubs a lot of the felt off needs to be packed better\\nEasy and very fast\\nThe 12 days of Christmas sale was great.

I have not had the service too long, but in the time I have been a member, I have found some good videos for my social media posts. It\\'s also good to know that if I find a video I like that is not in the free/members section, it won\\'t cost me an arm and a leg to purchase.\\nAlways enjoy receiving our packages and trying new oils.

Naively enough I didn’t really expect anything of it. On the phone he was saying how they have had a lot of accounts banned over the past couple weeks and that he could not directly trade, it had to be a drop trade. He talked about how they power level accounts and convinced me that he needed my login details so he could drop trade it over(again I was dumb enough to fall for this). After I log off he hangs up the call. I log back on 10 mins later, my entire bank is gone, and I never got the gold I paid $198 for.\\nI am currently waiting to hear back from them. I understand I am extremely dumb for falling for this.\\nI just want to give a heads up to anyone thinking of using this site.\\nvery nice and easy\\nThe suppliers on this site give you a fair price and fast delivery.I would recommend Ruby Lane anytime.\\nReceived product within a week.

It is a framed tile (lemon drop martini theme) which included a small wooden dowel which is inserted in the back as a prop.  Well, the hole which can hold the dowel would cause the tile picture to be upside down.  The other hole is way too small for the dowel.

The car I was assigned was in perfect condition, clean and functional. Overall a wonderful experience!\\nFees were high. The company had hijacked the Google searches so I thought I was making a reservation directly with Hampton Inn. Instead it went through this company and 117.00 of charges were added. I was also told best rate for the room was 149.00 but when I called the hotel directly they told me it was 122.00. \\r\\n\\r\\nWill never use them again.\\nWe have stayed at Holiday Express in Ohio, PA, and WV and have always been pleased\\nVery clean, very fast, and extremely efficient.

I have tried an other Church Supply store not too far away, but would still have to order from and they would either not have much in stock or seem to \"forget\" my order. I checked out Concordia online and found some very nice bulletins for what I was needing, a few clicks and I had every one of my bulletins ordered and paid for online and they arrived so quickly it really surprised me. I also got everything that I ordered too, nothing \"on back order\"\\nWe have always had top-notch service with TherapyNotes, without a doubt.\\nI chatted with Curtis and he helped me really  quick in the situation I was in.

She was knowledgeable and helpful from beginning to end.  Managed same-day delivery (on a Saturday!) and the delivery personnel were prompt, careful, professional and efficient.  They assembled my couch quickly, gave me a quick tutorial, and were out the door.  Great experience!\\nI am not quick to trust anyone and after talking to Raphael for about five minutes, I felt like he cared about helping me clear my credit.  Having someone in your corner you feel that you can trust can help in the decision making process, and allows you to breathe a sigh relief.  I think Raphael needs a raise because I am a tough cookie, and I look for the negative before I can see the positive.  Thank you Raphael, your assistance really meant a lot to me.\\nThank you very much.\\nhelpful and paticence\\nfound a ring my daughter wanted and i could not find it anywhere but here. thank you\\nMy comics were in pristine condition when they arrived. They were bagged, boarded, and packed neatly and safely. They were even labelled and stacked in sequential order! Thanks!\\nFirst time experience with Rooms Place and have already began informing our social network to look elsewhere. First impression was decent when we walked into store for first time. We saw a couch we liked and decided we would purchase at the Castleton location. There was an apparent Father’s Day sale of 20% we received. We put down $100 to hold the couch so we could go home and ensure the measurements would fit. We returned a little more than a week later to make final purchase. The original lady we worked with was not in that day. When we went to finalize things we were aggressively encouraged to buy the warranty. We said multiple times we were not interested in the warranty until we were informed if we didn’t buy the warranty the 20% discount would not apply. I found this to be completely shady and not buying the warranty and losing the discount was never mentioned in the beginning and was no where to be found in any of the written terms. I was not in the mood to fight at the time so we just purchased the warranty even though I had a feeling this was a shady practice and we were getting ripped off. We were also informed we could finance for 0% for 24 months the first time but then told it could only be for 18 months when we came back to finalize purchase. All this was one thing. Now, at this time, I’m writing this review after 9pm on a Saturday when we were told delivery would be between 3 and 6pm. We were called to let us know the delivers were hours behind and it could be as late as 8:30 but here we are at almost 9:30 with no communication and no couch delivered. At this point I’m not sure if we’ll even get the expected delivery tonight and I will be expecting a 100% refund for delivery fees and expect the couches to still be delivered. The majority of the experience with Rooms Place has been pretty pitiful since the beginning and I only hope management knows enough business and customer service sense to make things right for us. If you’re genuine about improving things and optimizing your business, there is some serious work to done and I hope it begins with correcting this experience of first time customers.\\nI went to a Mavis for a car state inspection, the technician inspected the car and I noticed he pull my tires off to inspect my cars brakes, before putting my tire back he hit using a hammer the drums maybe to put it in position and it cause it to loose some piece inside the drum probably the auto adjuster and when I left after first 2 mins I felt a bad noise coming from the exact drum that were inspected and hit with the hammer, I drove back to the shop again and the technician lift the car to inspect the drum I notice some pieces fall from the drum (a small coil and a little broken metallic piece) then he went inside the shop and came back after 5 mins to apparently put back the coil, I asked him about what happened and he didn\\'t explain to me what exactly he did to fix my car back, he only said everything is fine right now and because I was in a rush I drove off the shop, right now I have bad feeling, I don\\'t feel safe driving my car because he had to show to me what happened and what he did to fix it, I would like to go to a Mavis shop to have my car lifted and the tech show to me what was done there, thanks\\nI have booked two flights from JustFly and they have always given me the best deal. While it takes some carefully detailed reading, but if done right, you will have a really successful flight. I have had no troubles whatsoever on my bookings or my flight communication.\\nGreat company great Team\\nI got my first good pair of binos from Eagle around 1999. I liked how they let me check out a couple of pair before I decided. They\\'ve been helpful every time I\\'ve called them for one thing or another. Very recently, I\\'ve been happy with my new Zeiss from them--a great deal, too.\\nDelicious grapefruits, great customer service. We continue to order from this company and are extremely satisfied  !!!\\nI had a friend show me this site and i was excited. I order all of my supplements and get them from a variety of places. Its nice to finally order them all in one place. The fact that this company matches any other company\\'s price is simply amazing!\\nYour company has been incredibly helpful in my goal to become debt free. The process has been surprisingly stress free.  Advisors are very thorough and explain every detail and answer all questions you have. I would certainly refer anyone I know to Freedom Debt Relief.\\nI purchased 3 gift cards 1 month before needed for Christmas online. I keep waiting and waiting for these to arrived. I contacted kohl s almost 11 times w/ this issue and have an incident number I keep receiving emails trying to resolve issues and nothing so far.. I purchased new gift cards to send on time. Then 3 weeks later the other gift cards were delivered .Because of this store faults, I am having the running around with this issue. Kohl\\'s use to be very nice place to shop. Now it reminds me JCP(which is getting better now)\\nI really liked Wal-Mart until Spring time. I started looking for a pair of blue jean shorts. I\\'d been buying one pair Faded Glory. Went to website not any in my size on the whole website. Call corporate spoke to a young man said he would get it taken care of. Looked through Spring onto now. No change.\\nOne of book received the page was torn out\\nThe book was in a perfect condition (Almost new), costed much lesser and arrived on time!\\nOrdering the items was no issue at all! I ordered 3 different items and all were delivered in the right amount of time (together). One of the boxes just looked shredded and was untapped so it looked like people have opened them before.. For buying \"New\" products, sure didn\\'t look that way!\\nBooking experience was good, but could be improved.  I experienced a slight bit of difficulty with the calendar booking.  I could only see one week of the month at a time and had to scroll down to see the other weeks.  Other than that, everything was smooth.\\nGreat customer service\\nUser friendly and quick in use!\\nI booked two tickets from Bucharest to Barcelona, 18-21 May on March 19. On April 15th Vueling let me know the flight dates were changed to 15-21 May. I could not use them starting with 15 May (3 days difference than what I bought!!!). They agreed to refund only half of the trip because the returning dates were not changed. I didn\\'t see my half trip money yet, hopefully they\\'ll end up in my account. This is OUTRAGEOUS, I lost money in hotel reservation as well because of them. \\r\\nMy reference number, in case Vueling is interested: [SR_Number: 1-1477060139]\\r\\nI strongly recommend you choose some other air travel company.\\nThe cutout letters we chose, were exactly what we wanted. We are very pleased with the finished product. We wanted spooky, we got spooky! They came, when they said they would and they were packaged beautiful. All in all, we would recommend craft cuts to others.\\nVery nice invitations lots of great features, different options rather than the usual ones on evite, and paperless post.\\nThe print is fantastic and is as beautiful as the portrayal on the website.  However, this is the second print I have received from ICanvas that had no hanger installed on the print. The first time, I thought I missed the option when ordering but I was very careful the next time to make sure and there was no option.  I had to go out and buy a hanger and it was very disappointing to not be able to hang it as soon as it arrived.\\nI received the incorrect item.  The receipt indicated that I paid for the correct item, but what was shipped was different.  I tried an email to the company four days ago and have not heard a thing.  Not pleased.\\nOrdered a new iPad and had a mistake on my end related to the shipping, they did everything in their power to correct my mistake!\\nBest prices. User friendly web site.\\nI was perfect\\nLife fine has been quick to respond whenever the button has been tested. Thankfully, Mom has never had to use it for an emergency. She likes the wrist band as she is not as likely to set it off accidentally. Did not like the fall prevention as it was too cumbersome to wear on the neck, as is the necklace  life fone button.\\nShopping is way too slow. I don\\'t understand why you would promote a product you don\\'t have ready.\\nVery thorough and I learned a lot.  Called my insurance agent after the course and reduced my premiums based on information I learned in the course.\\nExcellent quality and really fast shipping. I like my belt a lot more then expected.\\nOutstanding products!!! I am not a huge seafood fan but I just LOVE the salmon, tuna and sardines from Vital Choice. I\\'ve never been a fan of tuna but their tuna is the best I\\'ve ever tasted. I can never stomach sardines but theirs are absolutely delicious. For my next order I\\'m going to try some mackerel - which I NEVER tasted in my life. Thank you so much Vital Choice. I can\\'t ever imagine eating anyone else\\'s seafood ever again.\\nPrompt receipt of item. Like the quality of my license plate holder.\\nAlways I get the best prices\\nI scheduled to be picked up at 0500, but at 0503 I received a text that the driver would be arriving at 0514. The driver was actually very pleasant and still got me to the airport in time to make my flight.\\nMy experience with Justfly.com has been moth & easy!

We are very pleased with our purchase.\\nShoes run narrow try next size\\nQuick, polite, they they keep being out of coffee.\\nDear Javier,\\n\\nThis was one of the best experiences I have had in dealing with insurance. I have been without health insurance for about a year. While trying to acquire insurance myself I had difficulty navigating the different care options in addition to thinking I would be unable to attain insurance until the open enrollment period in November. Javier you were very professional, and took out the guess work in determining what amount of coverage I needed that was within my budget. \\n\\nI hope all the employees at goHealth are as exemplary and helpful as you Javier. I no longer have to worry about my future healthcare needs thanks to you. Thank you for your time please know that your service is appreciated.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nMatthew Brenner\\nWhen I\\'m looking for books to purchase, ThriftBooks is my first stop.  Not only is a used book the planet-friendly choice, but my PayPal balance appreciates the prices too.  The website is easy to use, nice to look at, and my purchases are on their way the next day.\\nI ordered a dress for my daughters 16th. birthday. It was delivered to my door in just two days. We were very pleased with the dress its-self but it was too big so I got on the phone and immediately got a RA# from the customer service rep. We boxed the dress back up and sent it back. In the meantime, we ordered the same dress in a smaller size. We got that dress delivered to our door in four days and this time it fit perfectly!! On the same day we received the second dress, I received an E-mail refunding me for the total amount (minus $8 for the shipping) for the first dress we sent back! So overall, I\\'m very satisfied with the dress, the shipping time and especially with the quickness of the refund for the first dress!!! I will definitely use this company again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a dress. Thank you Promgirl.com!\\nTyler was a great help,the home was well cared for and clean.

Whenever I call my questions are answered promptly.\\nLooks like a nice product but the watch face is smaller than I thought it would be. I contacted them about returning it and it\\'s been a week since they said they\\'d get back to me. Not great customer service in my mind\\nI picked Travel VIsa Pro because they had the best price for my Brazilian Visa. They have good customer service, when I contacted the rep they were able to help me with my query. The service was quick and I had no problems. They even gave me a passport cover, bonus! I do wish, however that their website was more user friendly with clearer instructions and easier navigation.\\nExcellent service!\\nGreat opportunity, great service, great packaging, great timing, great value!...And a true comfort knowing we will be prepared with this product. Hope I never need to use it but it will be good to use it occasionally over the next 20years just to squeeze a little extra value from it for backup sake.\\nAsdfghjklqwerr\\nVery easy to do on their webpage as it can be translated into English. Also better prices. Easy to do.\\nMy book was as described and shipped very quickly. I had no problems with BookByte.\\nEverything came in a timely manner.

I originally ordered HD DVR and did not recieve it, I was charged much more than I expected and once I tried calling back I was informed about checking recordings and I was on hold for about 10 min. I am very close to canceling my account when I just got it....SMDH.

I really appreciated that! I would definitely rent from them again.\\nvery good to deal with\\nExcellent price but too slow on processing and delivery  Would like to see that shortened.\\nFirst time buyer. Easy transaction. Like that they offer PayPal for payments. I would do business with pro civic again. Keep up the good work.\\nQuicken has the easiest and most streamlined and efficient mortgage application and processing system I have ever experienced. MYQL is a great system. But any system is only as good as data input. But in this case Quicken employees are very prompt in answering questions asked in that aystem, and in providing information. I would recommend this company with great enthusiasm\\nI ordered a case of mini popcorn for my coworkers at Xmas time to let them know that I appreciated them after I had retired!

One gift we ordered was time sensitive and when I contacted cafepress because the order didn\\'t arrive as expected, they quickly shipped a replacement, no questions asked (it ended up being a usps error- delivered to the wrong address). Prices are already reasonable and I can usually find a coupon online too. Overall very pleased!\\nI recently purchased some stickers from Cafe Express. They were very unique.

A+ all the way.\\nYou have to try these,you\\'ll never buy from another company\\nI have found Western Bikeworks very easy to do business with.  They have great quality products at a great price.

Money is always ready to be picked up when arriving at payout location.  It is very convenient to be able to send money from the website right from home.  I tried using another company online and was told I\\'d have to wait up to 3 days for the money to be available.  I would recommend Western Union to anyone that need to wire money.\\nExcellent service.  Driver was quick to pick me up at airport and get me to destination.

I\\'ve been here twice. The first time they stayed open for me after 7 to get me back on the road.\\nThis store has got the WORST customer service. Never in my life have I     been treated in a store so rudely. I had someone bringing me a pair of boots and since they work on commission no one else was able to help me with another pair. That first guy was nowhere to be seen, and finally he came I was holding a few more styles that I wanted to try and he was like those are not available in your size. Those are the last pairs, and he was gone without even looking at them. So I proceeded to try on the floor sample boots which were my size actually, and then another guy (or maybe it was the same) came and grabbed all the boots away. You can\\'t try on floor sample boots. \\r\\n\\r\\nI settled on two boots that I wanted and tried again to ask anybody else to bring me the boots and to even just tell me the price. Nobody wanted to help me. Finally the original rude salesman came back, and he said he will bring it for me. He brought me only one, and he was gone. I tried again to locate him, and finally I did. I asked where is the other one. He said you can only try on one at a time. I am like: HU? I want to compare them!!! He said he will lose his job, if I want to try on another one together. So I asked him to speak to the manager. He said she should be around here. So I said can you please show me where. He said I can\\'t call her. I asked again and this time he said she\\'s on lunch. I said you don\\'t start that with me, so he said oh there she is. She was standing right in back of me the entire time. RUDEST, NASTIEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!\\nThe first round of proofs were delivered and we had something to work with.  Round 2 blew us away.  Three of the proofs were good enough and one was a home run.  The next few revisions were to dial in color and font.  We couldn\\'t be happier.  I will recommend The Logo Company in the future and I will use their services again soon.\\nThis site holds honest reviews, since one has the option  to rate  an experience good or bad. They have given us a reason to trust the reviews, as this is a persons day to day experience which builds up the trust and credibility of a company being reviewed.\\r\\n\\r\\n Trustpilot gives potential customers/buyers an honest feed back so that we can shop in confidence. \\r\\n\\r\\nA great site which takes away the stress of online shopping.\\nI enjoy being on google play...I have bought a lot of gifT cards lately....and the make my game play even better\\nEvery purchase adiquirido I have more confidence to buy more and am sure it will arrive. \\r\\nThanks for giving me that feeling\\nEasy enough to navigate the site and decent price, but I was a little disappointed in the print quality since it was a little fuzzy.  Granted, it\\'s a reproduction of an old poster, but I have that same poster on a shirt and it\\'s much more defined (family brought it from New Orleans).  It looked like the same thing online, but when it arrived (very quickly I will say), I could see the the image was not nearly as clear as mine. I bought it for a niece who saw mine and coveted it, so I hope she will be pleased with this one.\\nI ordered an engraved stethoscope from Medisave and chose the $13 fedex delivery option (only a few more dollars than the cheapest delivery option). My order was placed on a Sunday and received by Wednesday. Medisave sent me emails during the entire process including when my order was received, sent to fedex, and delivered by fedex along with the tracking info for my package so I could track it on the fedex website as well. I had a question about a code I needed to gain full access to the Littmann learning app and received prompt attention by their chat option on the Medisave website. My inquiry was handled quickly and I also immediately received an email containing my chat interaction and to make sure I was satisfied. Highly recommend this company plus their engraving was cheaper than other websites, came out exactly as expected, and faster delivery than other websites quoted for engraved stethoscopes. I will use Medisave in the future for my medical supply needs\\nMacs4u offers a high-quality product, easy and reasonable payment options and they went out of their way to make sure I got my Mac quickly and affordably.\\n\\nShort and sweet, they crushed the entire process. 5-stars easy.\\nTexas Power To Choose is the worse possible choice to assist you in getting a power company. The kick back they get must be really good, they recommended to us as the best possible choice TRIEAGLE power company with a 36 mths contract. Its more like the absolute worse company ever cause i trusted Texas Power To Choose. Now i am stuck with a company with 34mths left in the contract being ripped-off every month.\\nSomething needs to be done about companies like these.\\nmade both me and my with nauseous\\nI am very please with the service.

Their shipping is always fast, their selection is huge, and their price match is great! Would recommend to anyone looking for quality supplements at a good price.\\nThis site allows you to watch a video of Spanish speakers talking, providing you transcripts below along with translations.

We left our car for three weeks with no problems and we never worried about a thing.\\nFast reliable\\nI happen to call LENSKART at home & that was my biggest mistake. They sold some substandard stuff under the pretext of quality stuff & now are giving stereotype replies. The stuff did not even last a year and the lens coating got off causing scratch like appearances on lens making it unusable. Now the customer support is also very pathetic as they are giving stereotype replies. PLEASE NEVER BUY FROM LENSKART.

I bought my tickets to a Green Bay Packer game in June, I was travelling from Toronto Canada to Green Bay Wisconsin, and finally received my tickets via email (you charged me for shipping) 2 days before I got on a plane to go.  You guys never notified me that my tickets were available it was me calling your company, and finally getting somebody on the phone, I believe his name is Tyler who is able to get me the tickets emailed. I will never use your company again, and I will definitely be telling people I know never to use your company. A brutal experience, I’m only Being honest. \\nDavid Kendal\\nWow this place really sucks, they shipped the product, so they say, over a week ago.

Both the Sales and Customer Service folks were very helpful with the information necessary to finally get my hands on my item.  Even though I did get great help, it could have been better if we could have got the Name and address right, as opposed to the PayPal info.\\nThey want nothing more than to aid you in becoming a successful beekeeper, they do weekend workshops for free as well on top of selling great bee Nucs and other products\\nI was a little worried at first so I didn\\'t want to spend to much money on this so I got the 500 followers for like 7 bucks .

They cater to their customers and it is so nice to come back to a warm car in the cold winter months. My only complaint is that I did request covered valet and I am sure it was not covered by how dirty the car was. The valet also changed my radio station and had some hip hop station blaring when I got into the car. Not a big deal but I really see no reason to mess with the radio in patron\\'s cars. I will continue to use WallyPark for all my trips especially if I can get a groupon deal to lower the price.\\nShipping took forever! Maybe indicate more realistic shipping time for Australian customers. Otherwise excellent service and good website.\\nI was extremely happy with my order, it was a gift and she was very pleased with it, loved it.

Will definitely be shopping here again and again! \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks!!\\nI\\'m still in my trial run of Whistle, going on month 3. The technology and the idea of this is truly amazing. My only issue is simply geographical. I live in a small town and own a small corner lot. Until they get to a point where you can shrink the radius down, this is more built for people with a large plot of land. It updates position every 12 minutes, I wish it signaled you the moment the it left the whistle zone. That\\'s really my only gripe, but I\\'d definitely recommend this to anyone that has a dog that enjoys freedom, but loves to wander.\\nWas not thrilled with the elimination of the name your price tool. While it was chancy at times I did get some phenomenally great deals. Not sure if what I am reading is true but it appears it was eliminated because the process was too much for an impatient generation. I stll get some good express deals but gone are the days of $50 3 star deals.\\nYour work out clothes are very fashionable and cutie I get compliments all the time from my girlfriends, thanks Fabletics,\\r\\n\\r\\nSincerely, Annasofia. ; ~ )\\r\\n\\r\\nAna\\nKlia J has been very helpful.

Very convenient location, close to the airport, although we were grateful for the Waze app to get us there.  Staff were super friendly and helpful.  Upon our return trip, we were picked up within 10 minutes of sending our text.  Took several minutes for our car to be retrieved from the parking lot but in the meantime we were offered coffee, water, or hot chocolate while we waited in a very comfortable waiting room.  Our car was brought around in very short order with the car doors opened and our luggage loaded without us lifting a finger.  Very thoughtful and friendly staff, we were even wished well on our long drive home.  We will definitely be back.\\nThe time and dedication FDR puts toward solving my debts is remarkable.  I am extremely happy with the outcome of the resolutions they receive.\\nThe price was definitely the reason for chosing MrChewy.com. I am not sure what caused the treats in the bag to be broken into a lot of pieces. Maybe he shipping company caused it ? That would be my only complaint. May have to put more packeting around the treat bags. Received merchadise promptly.

Their solution initially was to give me $5 off my next order, which I would never use, and then it was increased to $10.  Imagine how much trouble I was in for missing my sweeties birthday and then not having them delivered the next day.\\ngolden tiger is awesome\\nIn the recent past the money transfer service has been flawless. WU handles customer issues promptly and with a lot of care.\\nTeeny, tiny imperfection on very carefully packed product (unreported). Customer service was great.

Thank you\\nMy plants arrived a bit dry this time, and more disturbing, the soil was gone from around the roots on some plants where the corrugated board was not covering the top. Five of six plants look pretty good, the one with the least soil around the roots looks iffy. It must have been a hastily done job. This is out of the ordinary for Bluestone. Usually the plants are adequately moist and the corrugated container is snug around the top of the pot.\\nNothing more to say never had a problem with an order and merchandise terrific\\nYou\\'re rising prices coupled with what I felt were cheapened variations of the products have caused me to put off on re-ordering for the for now.\\nIt matches up with your desired job\\nI was very pleased with the clock, order execution and receipt in Greece.\\nThese guys are great!

Living alone she tried to get herself up but broke her leg and had a minor stroke in the process.  At 4:00 in the morning she was on her own to move herself to the phone which was five feet away.  At 9:00 a.m. she finally arrived at the phone and called 911 for herself and then started calling family.  The family cringes at the thought that of what would have happened had she not been able to move at all?  How many days would we have waited to go see why she wasn\\'t answering our calls? What would we have found?  Thank God we never need to know the answers to those questions.\\nMedical Guardian gives Mom and all of us peace of mind that she will not be left alone even though she lives alone.

We were also told that they can\\'t give us back ups until the server is restored, which make me wonder if they really have a back up. HostGator has had zero communication with us and when I call they direct me to their forum. Where is the disaster recovery plan?!? If you have a backup put it on a new server/restore an image of the downed server. I have a hard time believing that this is only affecting a \"few\" customers. Their hold time has been 30 min plus and their chat over an hour and they are definitely NOT in communication with customers. Over the last few days we have experienced the WORST customer experience we have ever had and we will never do business with HostGator again, not because of the problem but because of the way it is being handled.\\nAlways have met my needs.\\ngreat service and  fast service.\\nOur order came quickly after we placed it, and the quality is great!

They acknowledged the fault and promised to deliver a new one, Now 6 months later we still have not received our battery. \\r\\ntheir support team is very friendly and keep saying they will look into the matter, but the result still is no delivery. We have lost more than a 100 dollars dealing with this firm.\\nService average\\nThe room was very nice, but very disappointed that the shuttle service stopped service by the time the plane landed and our luggage was available.\\nquick / easy.....I would recommend this site to anyone who would be looking for the airfare ticket.\\nTried to book a Santa for a holiday party, received 4-5 emails right away, most of which were booked, and I have no complaints about that. Had one quote sent and the price was right. Said i had about 2 days to accept the quote. When I went to book and pay, I received a confirmation and email that said we were good. A few minutes later received another email saying that Im sorry but we booked with someone else for that day and time. Very disappointing to say the least! Not sure I can blame gigsalad for this, but it would be nice to have functionality that provides updates so this type of confusion doesn\\'t happen again. I was told that I would receive a refund from the vendor, I\\'ll assume gigsalad will refund me my $15 usage fee as well.\\nThe signs we ordered for our new office are very sturdy as well as attractive.  A nice product at a really good price.\\nWebsite is easy to use and delivery of product was quick and accurate.\\nPleased with both products, quality very good and no problem with shipping or packaging.Large selection to make choices.

I will never use them again, ever, and I will also blast on every social media account and tell all my friends and co-workers how horrible they are!\\nFreedom Debt Relief truly is amazing! Anyone who is considering debt relief should know it is a last effort to get out of debt. When minimum payments are too much to pay or when debt is overwhelming, I highly recommend Freedom Debt Relief. The staff is friendly and understanding. I knew my credit score would take a hit but also my credit was on the way down with my debt being so high. I enrolled $55,000 into Freedom Debt Relief and now I owe $42,000. When you see a settlement reached you can take a breath. Freedom Debt Relief has helped and is still helping me reach my dream of being debt free.\\nSuper Fast Shipping And Excellent Service!\\nI bought so door slide rollers and they arrived quickly.

If your visit to Priceline is not early in the day, Priceline\\'s Express Deals apparently saves you more time without bidding tries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s OK to pay published hotel prices on Priceline, of course, and indirectly contribute to PCLN profits and stock prices.\\nI spoke with Mr Patrick Wallace, the talk since the begining was not just friendly, was direct, clear answers, clear questions, not cutting corners, I told Patrick what I need , Patrick told me what he need it, and with that info, I got my proposal withing few hours. That is the way I like to do business. Good Job Mr Wallace. Thank you.\\nReasonable cost for the area. Courteous people. Efficient operation, did not take long to get picked up. Car still where I left it and in one piece. Will use again.\\nHappy with prices!\\nI went into a store yesterday and asked about what I seen on TV and they showed me this very ugly set and said this what was on TV for 398. I was very unhappy I drove almost a hour away for a complete lie. I Will never go back. Just go to big lots same stuff way better prices and that\\'s real. Its not that I misunderstood anything just lies. You don\\'t have to be sorry for my inconvenience because I making sure everyone I know goes other places that\\'s neater and knows what items are worthwhile.\\nDue to the packaging the tablecloth was really very wrinkled. Not smooth. It was a perfect fit. I am hoping they will come out eventually. So far the little socks for the chairs are working out fine. Front pocket men\\'s wallet did not hold credit cards too well so the wallet didn\\'t closed properly. (Bulky) Also it still slipped out of front pocket.\\nThe associates were extremely helpful.\\nI used to only order my clothing from here because it was good quality and price, but now they charge way too much for shipping, and this time they even charged me duty!!!! And my invoice said 274$ but my credit card bill said 306!!! And that\\'s not the exchange rate either!!! Wtf. Never again. This is the last time.\\nAs a new consumer, I am still wet behind the ears when it comes to rating Trustpilot. I will be better able after using the service in a few months time. Signing on to the account was very quick and bodes well for the future! \\nColin P. an 83 year old  two fingered keyboard user !\\nI don\\'t have a problem with the taste or texture of the shakes.  The bars are good flavored also.  What I have a problem with is I\\'m STARVING all the time.  Even sticking to the suggested snack list I can\\'t beat the hunger.  I can actually feel a change in my clothing, however I haven\\'t lost any \"weight\".  Even the price of the items works out; I end up saving money bec I\\'m not spending $6 a day on fast food.  I\\'m still afraid I\\'m going to fall off anyway tho because of the starving. :(\\nThe mini birthday chocolate cupcakes were not only pretty to look at but delicious.  They were sent to my son in Oregon and he thoroughly enjoyed them especially because he did not have to share.  I just wish you had included candles.  Will definitely order from your company again.\\nI ordered some Dancing with the Stars merchandise for my Mom for Mother\\'s Day, loved the poster, the t shirt is the kind that is way under sized, i.e. it\\'s a large and I could wear it now as a medium and after a couple of washings, it will be a regular small, so order BIGGER, the fabric  just feels cheap, I will probably return the shirt, keep the poster .\\nI recently ordered an oak frame and some plexi. I was impressed with the sturdiness of the frame. The plexi comes with a covering on it that protects it while in transit. The packaging is very good, nothing can shift and get damaged. I assembled the painting in the frame with ease. The quality is very good and it came quickly. \\r\\nI had a little trouble with ordering online because I ordered two things that were oversized but they fit in the same package. You pay $15 for oversize, but I was charged $30 because I had two oversized items. I called customer service and they deducted $15 as they realized they could send it in one package. I appreciated the discount in shipping, but would not have gotten it by ordering strictly online.\\nPriceline offered the best price for our trip with hotel options and flight options that were not offered on other websites.\\nSite had what I wanted and shipped quickly.\\nHad a good experience with justfly getting a Cheap Fare price on a one-way ticket from Memphis to Seattle\\nI find the shipping charges somewhat high. I am thinking of going back to buying from local feed mill. The price comes out pretty much the same when PetFlow shipping charges are taken into consideration.\\nArrived on time and looked great. Thanks\\nGreat communication and shipping.\\nNow that we are a few months into Sling TV, I would like to begin with how we are overall happy with Sling TV.  We are also glad that your option is available as I was extremely happy to get rid of cable years ago and missed the regular TV options.  With that said, we do believe that there are a few improvements that we hope are considered.  We could not give your service a higher rating at this time. Thank you for allowing us to voice our opinion.  Have a great day. Carolyn & Family.\\n\\n1. Constant interruptions and losing signal.  This is not due to my internet speed and/or modem.  I have high speed internet with Verizon Fios and works very well with my other streaming channels. When I call your customer service it\\'s always a Sling TV issue.  Very frustrating. \\n2. Remote needs to have more button options to navigate faster, like a one touch \"last channel\" option. \\n3. Would be nice to have extra buttons on the remote in order to \"Preset\" channels we watch a lot.  Or, better yet, a screen we can navigate to that allows this option. \\n4. The \"OK/Enter\" button should be in the center of the arrows buttons (up, down, left, right), not below it for easier access.  \\n5. The \"Guide\" bar should be set up differently where we don\\'t have to toggle all the way to the right or left through every channel to get to the channel that we want to watch.  \\n6. Not enough local channels.\\n7. Would be nice to have a \"DVR\" type function/option for shows/sports/movies we may not be able to watch at the time it\\'s on.  This option should be included in the Orange/Blue option since we are paying for the higher tier package already.  Maybe this would entice more customers to pay for the higher tier package which would benefit Sling TV monetarily. \\n8. How about a delete option to remove some channels that we don\\'t want to watch or never watch that is on the guide bar.  For example, we are never going to watch \"Campus TV\" or the Spanish Channels, just to name a few. Waste of our money and space on the guide bar and again, the frustration of having to scroll through every one of those unwanted channels.\\n9. How about offering bundled packages for Sports instead of one price for NFL, another for NHL, another for MLB, etc.  Also, I would pay a little more to be able to watch our local teams on the days they are actually playing, instead of watching those games days later.  By then we know who won or lost, so what\\'s the point?\\n10. How about rearranging the guide. Let\\'s put the sports channels near the other sports channels, the movie channels with other movie channels, the news channels with the other news channels, the regular entertainment channels with the other entertainment channels, etc and so on and so on, instead of the jumbled mess that it is on the guide. Example:  NFL channel is currently all the way to the left and ESPN on the far opposite side of the guide bar.  Again, it brings back the frustration of having to scroll through every channel from one end of the spectrum to the other.  There\\'s no rhyme or reason for how the channels are set up currently.\\n11. Maybe place numbers on the remotes and then assign \"channel\" numbers to the programs in a guide to navigate easier and faster. You know, like a regular remote? Only having the up, down, left, right buttons is not enough and very primitive.\\nJack was a pleasure to work with.  However, I\\'ve not been as pleased with the product for the most part.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason I have not been completely satisfied with the product is a few things:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe set up directions I received with the product stated I was supposed to receive 4 support poles.  I only received 3.  When I inquired about this with Jack, he stated I must have received an older model\\'s set up directions and that the new models only have 3 support poles.  Jack assured me that there would still be enough support - however the balance of support seemed off to me, so I ended up purchasing another support pole for an additional $300 on top of the $8,550 I already spent for the display.  Additionally with the support poles, the latch lever does not close AT ALL on any of the latches.  The set-up directions state that the lever may not close all the way - however I find it odd that NONE of them close or latch at all.       \\r\\nAdditionally, when the 4th pole was delivered, I set up the display and found the side frames to be all scratched up.  My boss even asked if we had purchased a used unit.  They looked THAT bad.  I also was missing an 8ft jumper wire which made the LED lights blink in one portion of the display.  When I brought all of this up to Jack, he was extremely helpful and sent us out new framing that came in MUCH better packaging than what was shipped previously.  He also sent me the 8ft jumper wire that was missing.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWithout Jack, this experience would have been completely different.  He kept me calm and made me feel comfortable as though he could fix anything that was wrong.  He is a wonderful asset to the DisplayIt team.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI will say, however, that for the money spent on this display - I expected to receive all of the items necessary for this display with the first shipment and also not have them be so scratched up.\\nGaurav Lohat provided us  a good itinerary...\\nMy husband loved his gift for Father\\'s Day.\\nEverything came as we ordered and earlier than expected. Thanks!\\nGreat prices\\nHaving only discovered Enchanting Travels via the internet, I was a little nervous that they would not deliver the service or experience I was expecting.  This fear was put to rest upon our arrival in India where expectations of safe, fun and informative travel were not only met but exceeded.  The guides provided in the different cities will vary in personality and the accommodation will vary is style, to which you may have a personal preference, but that is to be expected.  Considering the driving conditions in India, we thought our driver was legendary! We would definitely consider using Enchanting Travels again in other countries where we do not feel comfortable organising our own land transport (e.g. hire care or public transport) or think we may have issues with breaching the cultural or language divide.\\nVery easy to communicate with. Made me feel comfortable about talking about my finances.\\nI have worked with Thriftbooks now for several years...and have been always treated right...with efficiency and care .This is an outstanding resource and service!\\nThis is my first purchase of a global phone and SIM, and Telestial made the experience very quick and easy.  Telestial was highly-recommended by several reviewers on multiple web sites.  The Telestial website provided thorough information on their offerings including phones, SIM card options, rates and helpful user guides.  I purchased an ekit Economy Pack for my son who is traveling to the Middle East.  The package includes an ekit 4C Dual Sim phone and Passport SIM Card.  The calling rates are much cheaper than our Sprint service, and the phone is a nice, basic text and talk phone which is exactly what he needed.  He has used the phone several times already from Jordan with great call quality and reliable signal.  So far the experience has been great, and I would highly recommend Telestial for global travel communications.\\nThe belts that I purchased are high-quality (and good looking) and their customer service (used because I was purchasing a custom belt) is excellent.\\nI have been ordering personalized cards for a while now, and receive many compliments.  The verses are just so perfect to express my sentiments at the holidays.  Thank You for a great job and a wonderful product.\\nThe representative I talked to was very helpful. There were times when I had to explain things a couple times, but eventually we understood each other.\\nOnly thing that bothered me was I didn\\'t revieve an email confirmation that my order shipped.  So no way to track it. Other than that, I recieved my order in a timely manner.  Thank you\\nShopping Experience was good, merchandise was of poor quality, and smelling of mold/mildew. The purse is not usable as it smells so bad! Disappointed!!\\nWhen booking a reservation it appeared it did not go through, no confirmation screen popped up. I tried 3 times. \\n\\nI had reached your site through an email so I closed out and went to your site and signed in with my log-in info. Surprise, I had  3 reservations all for the same time and date with 3-different reservation numbers. \\n\\nIt was resolved with an email and credited back to my credit card. Your customer service was excellent.\\nTop notch in every way.  I\\'ve been a customer since 2004.\\nOpticontacts had the brand I needed for way less than other websites. They came in the mail earlier than expected. I’m glad I did business with them.\\nVery good company. Great products and wide variety. Reliability in quality and shipments.\\nI have only used this for one week, but I already feel empowered. I think I can do this. The support, the tracking with NuMi, the tickers, the advice, especially the advice for getting through \"wobbles\" are all good. I\\'m disappointed with the food, however. Not that\\'s it\\'s not good for what it is (processed and microwave packages) -- but that it\\'s so heavy on cakes and muffins and sweet bars. I cannot abide sweets for breakfast, and that\\'s all there is... Even sweetened cereal and oatmeal. There is no way to get a package (on \"my way core\") that excludes breakfast and desserts without going ala carte, and I\\'m sure that\\'s far more expensive.  I am skipping a bunch of this and maybe if I meet my goal they will come in handy for snacks down the road. At least they have a long shelf life. The bottom line is, will I lose the weight, and with the portion control for lunch and dinner I think I can.\\ngood parts and free shipping!\\nEasy, efficient, Good Coverage, Reasonable Premium\\nJessie Mac played, Jessie Mac won, Jessie Mac is very happy and recommends this casino......... yay\\nVery nice, honest and patient with any questions I had. He also delivered very quickly.\\nI found that when I went to the web site it was very easy to find the Dentists on the plan and also very easy to fill out the registration paperwork.  I called the number to on the web site to get my Careington Dental number since I was going to the dentist right then.  The person I talked to was very helpful and quick.  With both my husband and myself on the plan it has already paid for itself with our procedures that we had to have.  Our cards were sent out very quickly and it is very easy when paying a the dental offices.  Thank you!!!\\nGreat prices and selections\\nI have been ordering from MyComicShop for over 10 years and with their large selection of comics, I have been able to find about 99% of the issues I want whether it\\'s a current title or a back issue from the 1970\\'s, and with their want list, I get notified fast when a title off my want list becomes available. Their website is very easy to navigate and checkout is fast and simple, plus their prices are better than most of the other online comic stores.\\nThe framed print arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  It really brightens up the eating area in our kitchen.  Love it!\\nAlways doing  what they say they will do and fast shipping .... good people to deal with\\nThis product is awesome. Perfect for a couple and very reasonable price.\\nfast shipping a product fir great..Thanks\\nwow cheap prices and excellent delivery\\nQuick and Cheap\\nDefinitely gonna buy again on this site.\\nvery helpful in finding good available storage in our areas\\nI have not had problems, but feel panicked that I have been unable to reach any human after hours of trying both personally and by my staff. I am CEO of an International non profit and if there are changes and I am unable to reach anyone as to why——it will affect many staff and children in bigger ways then time allows explaining here. I have not used this service before and it is my fault for using a new booking source perhaps. I will let you know how it goes if asked. But I am quite nervous that no person can be reached to ask even the most basic of questions not found online. I’m hopeful though. Perhaps it is just because I am new and don’t know how to use this booking Vayama ?\\nI found this company on line that not only had the part in stock but had a great price as well. Service and delivery were super fast and they kept me posted of progress by email right down to the tracking number.

Good selection and fair prices.  Shipping was quick and items arrived undamaged. Will purchase from them again.\\nExpert, reliable delivery service from people who always have the frames I need.\\nI have been paying $7.99 a month for the last twelve months.  I wanted to create an invite for my daughter\\'s first birthday party.  I tried logging on and couldn\\'t. The customer service was horrible.  I was only able to send an email to which it was never responded to.  I was just recently charged an additional $53.00 for attempting to re-establish my account, for services that have already been paid for.  HORRIBLE THEIVERY!! Will no longer use the service.\\nI loved the mattress I got!! Been searching for a good non toxic mattress for over a year, they sounded good but all had some kind of toxic material in the blend, finally I decided to go with Plush Bed,  quality, great price with absolutely nothing in the mattress that has toxic material which made me feel comfortable to sleep on! \\nVery happy with my choice especially the pillows they came with it... oh so heavenly soft and soportive to my sensitive neck! \\nThank you \\nElizabeth \\nSan Diego\\nTrying the bars...we\\'ve been using the shakes and love them!\\nI was very pleasantly surprised, after reviewing several companies, that select quote senior was able to get me great coverage at the lowest price.

No waiting for the shuttle to get me to the airport.  When returning from the airport, the shuttle was there within minutes.  When I arrived at Wally Park Airport Parking my car was there waiting for me.  Could have not had any better service than that.\\nGreat people who have been working there for years. Very helpful and fast service!\\nGreat will use again\\nThe CSR was very helpful during the entire process, until the very end when he charged me a fee of $49.99 that was no where on the advertisement you sent us in the mail.  Nor was it explained until the very end where my credit card information was already given and I had no choice but to accept the fee. The explanation for the fee sounded bogus to me.  Then I was switched over to the internet part of the process only to be told that I would be charged $34.99 instead of the $19.99 advertised.  And I had no choice at all then, because I would be charge the Dish cancellation fee if I changed my mind.  Honest advertising seems to something Dish needs to work on.  We love Dish programming and switched back to Dish because of that.  But I am not a happy customer right now.\\nI took multiple multiple  practice and multiple finals. Questions did not line up with review course. Literally sat with open review course to answer final exam questions. There were always enough questions UNANSWERABLE- some questions with not one legitimate correct answers. I used my phone, and two computers. I was going to pass!  I believe it’s set to not pass anyone.  Always the unanswerable to prevent the 80%!\\nPhillip Zinn did a great job getting my mortgage closed.\\nThanks!\\nI had problem with one of the  casters.\\n\\nCustomer service answered on a Sat. & i was advised that I would get a new caster to replace the defective caster.\\n\\nGreat Service.\\nHad language difficulties with your order taker, and he refused to allow me to use my 4 digits after my zip code on my label order.

They increased my bill to $90 a month for 50 down 5 up.  I actually get less than that - around 37 meg down.  So your rep was very helpful - got me set up with 50 up and 50 down plus Basic TV for a good price.\\nThey were very helpful.\\nI was completely shocked at how awesome the quality and attention to detail that was put into my order. I bought an infinity scarf for my sister in law, and it was on sale. I received a plastic envelope about 8 days later, that had a beautiful purple buttoned clutch inside labeled scarves.com on it, and inside that was my scarfs that was carefully wrapped in plastic. The scarf itself is knit and beautiful. So happy with my purchase!!!\\nvery nice watch and honnest price\\nAfter five years it was time for me to replace the carbon media in my PC-600.  I called Customer Service for assistance.  They were friendly and informative, however, that did not prevent me from having an unfavorable experience.  First, it costs over $200 for the carbon replacement kit, which is basically a sack of coconut shell carbon plus about $10 worth of plastic parts.  The replacement job is tricky, but it is expected to be a DIY.  I did try calling two of the plumbers on the recommended list supplied by Pelican, including the company that installed the system, but neither returned my call.  Pelican did supply a YouTube link which clearly explains the procedure, so I endeavored to do the job myself.  Every step of the way I watched the video, and reviewed the written instructions and it went flawlessly up to the point where I emptied and discarded the old media, poured in new media, and left it soaking for 48 hours.  The covering for my tube was made of plastic and it disintegrated when I removed it.  I reported this to Customer Service and they informed me that Pelican discontinued using plastic, my five year old system did not guarantee replacement, and I would have to purchase as stainless steel cover from them for $143.  So the 48-hour soaking period was extended several days while I waited for the new tube covering.  When the covering came, it did not fit over my tube.  Customer Service was pleasant and agreed to send me a new tube for no extra cost.  I had to wait another week for it to arrive.  Then I had to empty the soaked media from the old tube, remove the down tube and place it in the new tank, and carefully pour in the soaked media into the new tank.  Now I am in the 72-hour period of not using high flow appliances, such as laundry and dish washer, and my water will be charcoal tinted for about 10 days.  This part is normal for everybody.  You replace the old carbon and soak the new for 48 hours.  For the next 72 hours, you have to bypass the system when you use laundry of dishwasher.  For me it took much longer.  I have spent $350 and engaged in a month long process, just to complete the media replacement that needs to be done every five years.\\nI love to cook and these boxes, while easy to prepare, have meals I wouldn\\'t have made otherwise.   The food tastes great.   I found with the other companies it was too basic for me.

Will be surprised if it lasts us one winter season.  Three of the water bags would not hold water!\\nBuses were overfull. Standing room only and packed in like sardines. Waited over an hour at one stop for next bus. Bought a 2 day pass and only used one day as it was to much of a hassle. Biggest waste of money on our vacation!\\nMerchandise came sooner than expected. Will definitely order from ur company again. Thank u\\nThis was our first time using a pet sitter through trusted housesitters.  Within a few days of posting our need for a pet sitter, I had several responses and was able to chose the one that I thought would best meet our needs. We had an excellent experience.  Our pet sitter left the house in excellent condition and our pet was happy and content when we returned home.\\nI am an SR. Interior Designer working in bluu gulf (Qatar) looking for unlimited future in my field that\\'s why i am visiting Turkey in that time because of the Annual Furniture Exhibition.\\nThe place is in the center of the city with a lot of restaurants, easy to walk to the monuments, is near to the airport bus, to the railway station, university, cathedral ..\\nMy room had a practical balcony. There was air conditioned but I did not use it.\\nThe breakfast was not bad.\\nThere is no elevator, the shower is so little that you can not bend to wash your feet, although the rest of the toilet is clean and correct\\nThe worst aspect was that the nearest building was a Hostel with people very noisy and a lot of time shouting,in a street closer there was a Karaoke Pub and the music was very loud until 2:00 AM, every day.\\nAny case the staff of the Hotel were very friendly and I spent a good week there.\\nPartsgeek is the absolute Worst online parts company ever!!!!!! They sent me a huge Ford truck radiator, but I ordered one for Cadillac cimarron! They Suck!\\nworks for me!!!!!\\nItems came quickly and were as expected.  Didn\\'t give a five as I had problems using their coupons as advertised.  They did honor them when called.\\nI live in hotels for work during the week so it\\'s worth my while to use priceline to save money. Sometimes it\\'s super easy and sometimes it takes a while.\\nI had 2 instances in which I had to call priceline and the first time was very difficult. The second time was a piece of cake. Inconcistant but oh, well, it saves per diem!\\nWe enjoyed our stay at the cabin \"Live With Passion\" tremendously.\\r\\nThe cabin was well laid out, had great amenities, and was very clean.\\r\\nThe cabin is conveniently located between Gatlinburg and Sevierville.\\r\\nWe enjoyed time together in the game room and the jacuzzi.\\r\\nUnfortunately we could only stay 3 nights, but because we liked it that much we are considering coming back in the summer and stay longer.\\nGreat job.

I am pleasantly surprised and would recommend them\\nAfter finally finding what I was looking for, Word Anywhere was very helpful in getting the size and wording that I wanted.  I did have a few questions that I e-mailed to them and they responded very quickly.\\nGreat customer service, David is great at what he does.\\nOrdered dec 14 was shipped the next day.

Called & could not send replacement till ordered 2nd & paid for second one. Hopefully will send new one tomorrow. Very lousy customer service.by the way the price was increased as parts went up... Now free shipping. Wow way to go.\\nNo hassles.  Sold my books, got my money.  \\'Nuff said\\nShipped quickly and and correctly.\\nCardpool was taken over by another company last year. The formerly stellar customer service is now garbage. The selection of cards available is greatly reduced. The discounts are smaller. And, you can no longer see your Wishlist (now called Favorites) all in one place. You have to go through card by card by card to find out if you\\'ve added a card to your Favorites.  The website is also much harder to navigate since they \"improved\" it.\\nMy experience with Career Builder has been satisfactory.\\nGood selection, good prices, fast processing\\nGreat product\\nI placed my order easily online. My mat boards arrived quickly and well package. I will definitely be ordering more products in the future.\\nit was fun taking this online because of the animated graphics; I can\\'t imagine doing the same thing on any ither platform which wiuld have been boring and cumbersome. The information provided is to the point and it has definitely increased my knowledge of the rules, regulations and safety. Thank you comedydriving :)\\nOrdered Thursday couch arrived Friday.

Love my Oofos! Would like more styles with more support around the foot too.\\nA Little Skeptical at First\\nFlightsbird appears to use 3rd party vendors to handle their transactions.  So I experienced a language barrier problem. I was a little hesitant with giving my credit card information over the phone because I thought it was a scam.  Then my rep emailed me my personal information back to me with my full card information for verification.  Then I was really getting nervous.  But the rep never lost contact with me.  He called me directly all the time.  The 1st flight itinerary didn\\'t go through but the 2nd one did and my flight is confirmed and it was a much cheaper rate.\\nA wide selection of furniture catered to all costs.  Same day delivery and setup for a minimal fee.  Will definitely purchase furniture from there again and have already started telling friends and family to go visit the warehouse.\\nTrusted Translations has been a life saver! Their customer service is spectacular and they go above and beyond the expectation every time. \\n\\nWe recently signed up for an account that would allow us to call in and get a translator on the phone immediately. The service helped us overcome several challenges. I was even able to find a translator that spoke Bosnian.\\n\\nI would highly recommend their services.\\nThe process was simple and quick. The turn around time for funds available was within 24 hrs. I would recommend Plain Green to everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nDerrall Brown\\nThe entire process was easy and the agent answered all my questions, additionally Select Quote offered me the best price.\\nThis was great, the duplicate diploma looks just like the real thing which I unfortunately lost in my military deployments from duty station to duty station.  Thank you!!!!!!!!!\\nThis is our 4th year using Cards Direct and we are always very happy with the quality and convenience of ordering our holiday cards. I loved that the address can now be printed on the envelopes it makes it so much easier. Always pleased with your service. Thank you!\\nReservation process was easy. Bus was clean and comfortable. Bus driver Richard was professional and pleasant. He was always where he was supposed to be - we never had to wait for him. Great experience.\\nApplied for credit online, worked great and is being delivered 3 hours away in 3 days, can\\'t beat it.\\nThis was so helpful! ! In a time of great need I found a place to store all my stuff for a great price in only a few minutes!\\nThis site made my search for peat plugs simple and quick.  I was able to find a good quantity of the seed starter plugs and order them with ease.\\ngreat experience!\\nBooked a car a day before arrival, hours before pick up it was confirmed they had the vehicle desired, upon arrival the car wasn\\'t available, not even at the time of confirmation as told, the category of vehicle on the confirmation letter wasn\\'t in compliance with the rental office\\'s own, the desired vehicle wasn\\'t available for even some days further on, not even in offices around 100 miles radius. It ruined our holiday plans, even though the rental office gave us a free upgrade for the whole time as an appology though not their fault as said. Summary: Discover Car Hire confirmed a car make that wasn\\'t there (not even similar) and were mixed up with the categories of vehicles. Never more.\\nThis company is a SCAM!!!! Do not use!!!!!\\nThey booked the wrong hotel for me and when I got the confirmation email and noticed the address was incorrect they refused to transfer to correct hotel or refund my money.  Also, I noticed imediatly after booking and room was scheduled a month out. They lead me to believe I was speaking directly to the hotel I was trying to book. SCAM ALERT!!!!!!\\nNo prob a at all\\nWhile it\\'s working, the quality of phone calls is ABS great!! Using an ATA enables me to use regular phones and there is a software (Windows) app that enables me to take my phone with me as I travel, which is FANTASTIC.\\n\\nBut... our calls are seemingly, randomly dropped after 10-55 minutes which is extraordinarily frustrating. I am looking at the ATA provider first (OBI200/202) for this problem. The softphone app has its own set of issues, such as the inability to answer if I have the headset selected as the speaker (no problem answering if I use the computer speaker).\\n\\nFor these two issues, I\\'ve taken stars off. As these issues are resolved, I will update (if I can) this review. It is my plan to use Phone Power for my residential line (yeah, yeah) replacing Vonage, and for each of our business lines replacing Skype -- my partner & I each have home/remote offices when we are not on site with customers -- separate businesses.\\n\\nAdding on to the original review, Tech Support sent me a link for additional information that identified additional port ranges to allow that seems to be key in my dropped calls issue. Since implementing these _additional_ ports, dropped calls have...  dropped off.\\nOutstanding customer service, outstanding product.\\nThe guides are amazing, the itinerary had the right combo of activities and down time, food was great, crew were kind and attentive, and they were flexible with maki changes where needed (added another snorkelling stop on our last day because everyone wanted it).\\n\\nHonestly? The worst part of it was having to leave. I seriously considered staying on an additional week.\\n\\nIsaac, the doctor, was knowledgeable in all things, not just medicine. He was attentive to those that had issues and even came along on the tours to help those that needed it.\\n\\nThe whole team really pitches in with Quasar. I will definitely be booking with them again.\\n\\nOkay, just one thing I didn\\'t like- the Ceviche appetizers. \\n\\nThey are great- highly, highly recommend!!\\nParm gave great service and a good deal!\\nI just love the service my father gets from the LifeStation! I feel secure at work now and know my father is well taken care of. We have had to use this a couple of times and the response times are just incredible! My dads care was so quick! He is very happy and secure at home now! Thank you so very much! Would recommend Lifestation to anyone.\\nGreat Casino, Great Bonus and Great Support!! I would recomend everyone to join Birwo, super fast Cashouts!\\nThe combination of an easy to navigate webpage and very good quality bundles makes this one of the best places to find deals. Thank you Bundle Stars for your steadfast commitment to Gamers!!\\n44 kitchen, and bathroom cabinet knobs installed. Awsome job, clean, professional, quick and easy. Wonderful cleaning up also, thank you :)\\nEasy process.\\nThe book I ordered was used and reflected overall good condition.  Delivery was as quoted.  The price was less than half of what was quoted on another website.  Good experience.\\nI ordered a new paddle, which was on sale (yay)......it\\'s a nice lightweight graphite paddle......quick turn around to delivery........racket plays nicely, but wish the handle was just a tad more slender\\nMy entire wardrobe consists of Fabletics apparel. I\\'ve been a VIP member for awhile now and I absolutely LOVE everything Fabletics has to offer.\\nI ordered some items to update my dinnerware & a really nice NINJA FOOD PROCESSOR for my kitchen !!!!! \\r\\nwhen the items were shipped .....the packaging was extremely protective for the heavy place settings!!!!!\\r\\nI am impressed!!!!!!\\nVery good, clean facility and friendly staff\\nJohn was so patient and professional in explaining the benefits of allowing Credit Associates to assist me with my deliquent accounts.\\nI was very happy with the desk nameplate I ordered for my stepson.  It turned out to be one of his favorite Christmas gifts - so I was queen!\\nVery different from the videos I previewed.\\nIt took over a month to get my order in...was losing hope & customer service needs a lot of work. However, the watch is nice.\\nGreat prices\\nI have ordered many times and sent to prison facilities.  This time the packaging was wrong so the recipient wasn\\'t allowed to have them. Issent an email to thriftbooks.com and was basically told too bad. I won\\'t order from there again if you don\\'t make it right.\\nMaking the reservation went without a hitch, it was fast and easy, and I would use this site again, and will use it again in the future\\nI love it and they have great clothes.\\nVery good experience\\nThe University of Metaphysics provides a wonderful balance of practical, enriching programming and personal support. My experience has been incredibly empowering, and I am grateful to have discovered this unique school.\\nparts geek had the part I needed at a REALLY GOOD price; even with shipping and handling, it was very reasonable.  The part also arrived in a short amount of time.  Thanks parts geek!\\nEasy to navigate and to check out!\\nIt has been a great experience booking my flight through JustFly. It showed all the cheapest and possible flights and UI is pretty comfortable.\\nI was not blown away by the quality of the shirts, they felt cheapish and for the price I was not impressed. Definitely overpriced. The real problem though is how long it takes to ship, make sure you give yourself a good 20+ days to receive any product from them. Most online retailers ship right away and I\\'ve found it takes almost 8 days for them to ship a t-shirt, not worth it! I ordered a sweater from Tipsy Elves the same night I ordered a t-shirt from Threadless and it was delivered 5 days before the Threadless t-shirt even shipped.\\nI ordered letters to put on the round down tube of my bicycle.  This was the first time I have ever tried a product like this and I was a little hesitant.  My fears were completely unwarranted.   The whole process was supper easy and the results looks GREAT.  The quality appears to be excellent.  I am very highly satisfied thus far and am trying to think of other ways I can use this product and service.  A five star rating without question from me.\\nI didn’t need any customer service in particular. I placed the order online and it was there in a few days.\\nGreat value to explore New York city\\nOrdered and paid for complete set (6) of piston rings for 911 Porsche.  Partsgeek sent quantity for one piston.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdered 84mm rings for 911T.  Box was labeled 85mm for 911E.\\r\\n\\r\\nTimed my order for delivery to my mainland visit.since partsgeek disregards AK and HI in many cases.  I am back in HI with no option to get correct order from Pts gk.\\nAll i can say is that they did what they said they would do.\\nI love it online and in store\\nYou should have a coupon code of a 3% discount for ALLKEYSHOP like a lot of others do. That\\'s how I found you. Pricing is good , could be just a tad bit lower on some games. But I\\'m really satisfied with your services overall.\\ngreat company! will invoice the church....that was a great option because otherwise my husband and I would need to be paid back and that\\'s always a little annoying....thanks so much\\nWhen I called they had me with an agent forover 30 minutes. The gentleman was clueless, kept having to put me on hold. Then he screwed up the transaction and when I called back, i was on hold for 3 minutes and then someone picked up but never answered. You could hear the discussion in background. They are clueless on how to operate a call center. Zero customer focus.\\r\\nRun from Hotwire!\\nGreat perfume and cologne selections \\nGreat prices! I will order again. I got 14 bottles for $255/ gifts for Christmas\\nRalph Lauren Blue\\nEternity\\nEscada sentiment\\nEscape\\nBora bora men\\nBora bora women\\nCk one\\n\\nA different amount of each. Some where in their boxes. If it was for myself or my husband I got a tester bottle for up to $10 cheaper in most cases. Still came in a white box with a label. I will definitely shop here again. Already cheap prices with the sale great deal\\nOrdering was simple and straight forward. Prices were competitive.  All items arrived when they were scheduled. Nothing negative to say.\\nI am very happy I used them. They do all the work I don\\'t have time to do. You can\\'t go wrong because you have plenty of companies yo choose from.\\nAll I can say is that Passports and Visas.com deliver what they say they do. Our Account Manager, Danyelle Castro, held our hand through the entire process. We are on our way to the Bahamas!!!\\nWhen I was first told about Dogvacay, it was easy for me to find several hosts near me and set up interviews.  I was very impressed with the caliber of people who were opening their homes and providing quality care of all ranges of dogs.  I now have two favorite hosts that I use regularly.  It is easy to schedule appointments and get immediate responses.  I always feel that my dog is getting excellent care and I love the fact that I receive pictures and notes on my phone when we\\'re away.  That gives me great comfort.  Thanks, Dogvacay, for your great service!\\nno one else better!\\nbought groupon pass and expected hassle during check out.  but everything was fine..  paid $33 for 5 day pass...\\nFast shipping grate products, please keep up the good work. Definitely will recommend to friends!\\nthanks for the tv\\nthe rental rate is little bit lower than the regular car rental company but the service is a lot worse. they seem not setup for the business yest and the service is very bad. however, the car is good\\nNo issues.  Fast shipping and exactly what I ordered at a reasonable price.\\nIt took 2 techs nearly 9 hours to complete the entire process for our small home (under 1200 sq ft.), this was just too long in my opinion. The installation techs were friendly and polite, however, the lead tech made an error when calculating the sensors in my package and I ended up having to pay out of pocket, when I had already made it clear I did not want to do. This package was already discussed over the phone when I set up the appointment, so I did not appreciate the pressure and hassle of having to revisit this. And to further emphasize, I was told over the phone that I would get 2 key fobs, but this was part of the tech\\'s error the day of installation. I\\'m not a fan of pushy salespeople and so far that is what I have encountered with ADT, throwing in extra yard signs is not my idea of a deal. From what I can tell, the system works fine and we feel safe and that\\'s what matters, but as far as my interactions over the phone and with the installation techs I was not impressed by their honesty or efficiency.\\nHarshit is very knowledgeable and helped me out for correct flight and other options. Good job...!\\nThey got a dentist I needed in quick time.\\nMike at Flashbay was very easy to work with and I was happy with the product.\\nNot perfect but strives to make its customers happier.\\nGood stuff. A pity I won\\'t be able to enjoy any of it. Shipping is outrageous to 00929 zip code area. A flat rate priority with USPS would do it but it\\'s not an option. My loss as well as theirs. I was able to get the free digital downloads so I\\'m grateful for that. Thank you\\nThe book came within two days and was practically new.\\nvery good . Thanks\\nGreat.. finding movies that I have been looking for years for. I\\'m a hooked customer.. and the prices are great too..thanks again\\nThe sizing and quality of the t-shirts were above my expectations!\\nI have ordered from Hale Orchards many times and have been pleased with the quality of the fruit but this time the product was not up to standard. I ordered Sugar Bells and while some were juicy and sweet, I was disappointed to find that over half of them were dry and unappetizing. Was there a drought or had they been in storage?  This shipment was an unpleasant surprise.\\nTook longer then I thought, but all went well\\nQuality items, fast delivery, nice sales\\nWe tried to book a flight, but something failed and the tickets was not book. But the money was still reserved on our account. We gave them a call and the money was released a week later. Not perfect, but also not fraud.\\nThese guys are awesome!\\nI didn\\'t know what to expect when I called cruises.com, but my experience was great.  My agent, Emmy, explained everything to me, and answered all my questions honestly and thoroughly.  Great service!\\nI would recommend the company and all of the workers to everybody\\nThis was my first order with PartsGeek and I am very happy with the ease of ordering as well as the quick processing and shipping I received.\\nThere is nothing better, than to be able to go on vacation and not have to worry about your fury child.  Especially after being in situations where my pet was not fed and lost weight, came back from vacation to have to rush him to the Vet or him bring crated after we were told he would not be. \\r\\n\\r\\n With dog vacay, their Petsitters are seriously screened and they have their own pet insurance.  I\\'ve utilized dog vacay in Florida, Maryland and Virginia and have had nothing but great experiences.\\nFrom a wide variety to choose from, to great prices, and quick service I\\'m delighted with my purchase. The ink cartridges aren\\'t the quality I\\'d like, but the pens look great and I\\'m proud to hand them out.\\nThe price is reasonable, however the customer service lacks  a little to be desired. Total time for submission from bookit.com to resort took three days. Upon requesting desired room number,  I was presented with a smaller unit than requested. \\r\\nPlease be advised, you the customer must have all pertinent room information available when interested in booking (they have no knowledge of room info).\\nTold me they\\'d pick up a pkg. between 5-7PM window.  Came at 3, banged loudly over and over on door--my kids are home, I wasn\\'t yet--but they are not allowed to answer door.  Driver left rude note on door, about how I left him \"waiting 5 minutes\" and he has \"other customers.\"\\n\\nI call UPS\\'s (very foreign!) CS center, wait 18 minutes only to be told that my tracking number and pick up confirmation number do not register, and they had no idea when the driver would return.\\n\\nWere this not for my company\\'s relationship with UPS, I\\'d go to FedEx.\\nDid what it said on the tin –\\xa0the site was easy to use, and the car I booked was waiting for me when I arrived.\\nThe problem I have is that every small company once it gets good Angie\\'s Review is not able to keep up with customer demand.   So e.g I signed up for a deal from Eagle Electric and I had to wait a month before the work actually began. Then I was told that the person had to go to Jury duty and it got delayed further.\\nMy order was handled efficiently and quickly.  Delivery was fast.  I\\'m pleased with the transaction.  Thanks.\\nThank you for helping me in my time of need\\nThis was my first time usimg Just Fly and I am glad I chose this site rather than the ones I usually use.

He went above and beyond to repair our stove\\nfriendly quick arrangement, very clear appointment\\nI compared all online agents. Just fly prices was by far the best\\nGood rate. Easy to use\\ngreat price and shipping was very fast\\nI ordered compression stockings that were suppose to fit up to 24 inch calves and they wouldn\\'t fit over my ankles.  Did return them and they have acknowledged they were returned but stated my money wouldn\\'t be returned for 1-2 billing cycles--gee I wish I could pay my bills like that!!\\nOur dogs were very well cared for and were loved and treated as part of Sherry\\'s family.\\nThis is my first order very excited to see the product!!\\nWe booked  a king size bed for honeymoon We got to hotel it had 2 queens Also asked people mount of all fees taxes everything done 2 days into our honeymoon I started getting new charges on my card for parking I complain to hotel and they took 2 days off of the 4 days of parking I tried to contact get a Room customer care to complain waited on phone 20 minutes never got to talk to anybody so I will never be book in another Room through them again\\nThe camera package I bought dropped in price by $50 two days after I made my purchase, but they wouldn\\'t offer any type of refund or price-match. Which is clearly stated under their policies, so they did nothing wrong. However, it makes me wary of future purchases.\\n\\nOn the plus side, it was still a nice package price; and the various items arrived quite quickly and safely.\\nI would use this company again! It worked out well\\nBeen using cardpool for years never had a problem.\\nI appreciate that your site, unlike several others, is has always been very easy to navigate. It is also complete with links that go directly to a verifiable job posting.\\ndecent prices, friendly professional staff, car was lovely.\\nI prepaid $70 to WallyPark Orlando for a trip that, just the day before departure, my doctor advised me not to take.  I obtained a written explanation from my doctor but sadly I forgot to get online and cancel the WallyPark reservation until 20 minutes after my scheduled arrival time.  There rules clearly state that you have up to just before the scheduled arrival to cancel for a full refund.   They didn\\'t just charge my for a day\\'s parking, kept my entire payment!  It was a $70 hard learned lesson.  Don\\'t deal with these people.  Search them out on other sites and seek out the negative reviews.  Believe me it won\\'t take much effort to find them.  I believe any reasonable business would have bent the rules to keep a customer happy.  NOT WALLYPARK\\nMRS AMY WAS VERY HELPFUL and willing to work with me.\\nGREAT SERVICE HOPE TO USE AGAIN.\\nFast excellent service. Full clear explanation of operations, t&c, personally took me to storage locker to confirm that it was clean before taking over\\nThe website was not responding after several tries. It got hung up at the point where you choose if you’d like flight insurance or not and would not let me complete my booking. So I had to book through the phone. I spoke with Logan. He was very nice. The time on the phone was a little excessive but Logan was very helpful. He did what needed to be done to complete my transaction including several calls and emails. Website just needs to be fixed.\\nI never was able to get it to complete\\nSpent years ordering from the \"other\" famous ham company and only now discovered Burger\\'s. This ham is far superior than the \"other\" and all the rest. And just when you think it can\\'t get any better -- their service quality will impress you. So nice over the phone and the ham was delivered right on the day they promised. Burger\\'s will now be part of all our holiday meals.\\nGreat service, really recommend it - fast, professional, accurate translation.\\nPrompt service and competent staff.\\nWe were looking for a great place to build our business and reputation.

My brother-in-law loved it.\\nI must admit that Simplilearn was a good guide throughout my journey to get the ITIL certification. The online videos, sample tests and the books on ITIL were a real help in understanding the standards.Sincere advise from my end is that, Course content is good but does not prepare you for sample exams provided which are a lot harder than the quizz questions in the course. You need to study additional material to prepare.I liked the customer support and the approach. Thanks again guys. Keep up the good work.\\nI haven\\'t been with AAOA long, but have found that customer service is great, prices are fair, no complaints.\\nI bought LED headlight bulbs and they work great.

We are talking about almost 17 years. This was my first system as a kid. And all the games that I used to play are priceless. I never had any toys but video games are those that I still have in my mind. Playing old psone games again brings back those childhood memories of eating junk food and just relaxing after school on the couch.\\nAll the items I ordered for friends and family for Christmas was wonderful....everyone said they were delicious.\\nWe are pleased to say that, your server has been outstanding, 100% UP i.e. highly availabile, fault tolerant, has fulfilled all our needs till date and has given good response to webpage loading.

There was a problem with the Vacation Express (Nexxus?) person who was not where he or she was supposed to be (for hours) to let us know when the shuttle would be picking us up, and we spent a fair amount of time trying to find this simple but essential bit of information.  We would have preferred to be spending our last day on the beach, relaxing, instead of pursuing someone who did not show up for work.  The hotel itself was extraordinary.  This was our 7th Mexico (Cancun or Riviera Maya) trip with Vacation Express and one of the best places to stay.  We have nothing but praise for the hotel.\\nGreat selections outstanding quality. Will continue to purchase from their site.\\nWhile the daily rates were cheaper than most in the area, I would NOT recommend going to this location if you have anything of value left in your vehicle.  I had personal belongings in my vehicle (hidden in my center console), and they were not in my vehicle upon my return.  It says a lot about a company when their employees need to steal from their customers.  I will gladly pay full price at the airport next time to know my vehicle and it\\'s belongings are safe from theft.  The shuttle driver was very nice - that was the only positive from this whole experience.\\nSeems that item are often miss graded. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome sellers are willing to work with you and others blame you for their mistakes. \\r\\n\\r\\nDiscogs seem to take the easier route and just side with the seller opposed to working the issues out. \\r\\n\\r\\nGood when no issues arise but that seems to be few and far between.\\nA good experience of GoDaddy from the word go!

My car was safe no stress!!!  I would use global parking again !!!\\nWe had a great experience with The Futon Shop.  The salesman was very thorough and helpful, without being pushy.  And we are very happy with our mattress.  We\\'ve slept great since it arrived, and we don\\'t wake up stuffy and congested like we did with our old mattress.  And it was a bonus that the mattress arrived smelling slightly like a sheep.  :)  I loved that!\\nOrdered shirt, it was mailed fairly quick. It is a present. Looks good\\nStaff and service are great\\nJason was very helpful in helping me (as a first time customer) decide which product worked best for my needs. iPromo did an excellent job personalizing my items and the pricing was very reasonable.  Customer service is VERY important to me and my experience with iPromo will absolutely make it easy to remain a customer for the foreseeable future.\\nGreat quality fast shipping.\\nFound it frustrating that there was a costly \"handling fee\", but was willing to pay it because the items we needed were available to purchase. Using the website was easy, but when our items didn\\'t arrive after almost 2 weeks we became concerned. My wife called the company to be told that the items were backordered and wouldn\\'t be available for 2 months. We found our frustration in the face that no one made us aware of this until we made a phone call. We were informed that a salesperson would be calling us to make us aware of the situation. Two things, one we didn\\'t even know we had a salesman we were working with and two it was two weeks and no one had contacted us - we had to initialize contact. Now, saying all that - the customer service operator we talked to was very nice and helpful. She took care of getting us a full refund. Would I purchase from them again - not sure.\\nJake Radke was great.  Friendly, fast, smart.  Got the information needed and answered all of my questions, followed up as he said he would and got me the coverage I needed.\\nThanks Jake, appreciate your help and pleasant manner.\\nworst thing I ever tried.

Daniel Madsen\\nBEST PRICES i COULD FIND ON UNDER-CABINET, led FIXTURES!\\nexcellent prompt service with a good price\\nThe sute us confusing, especially the payment page.

No muss, no fuss.\\nI\\'ve been using career builder services for a few years now and I have have fast responses from employers.\\ngreat service.\\nOverall experience was OK. the monthly cost is overpriced. Conflict between the customer care and technician\\'s comment on service and devices provided.\\nMy order was received very quickly.  Ordering was easy.  I received only the cap and not the entire cover which I thought I was ordering.  Disapointing to pay that much for the cap and not the other part.  Nothing that said it was seperate.  I doubt if I will order anything else from them.  To much to pay for part of what I needed.\\nWorking with BFS has been a pleasure.  They are very professional.\\nI\\'m quite happy with the products I order, although shipping is slow and rather expensive. I understand that isn\\'t really your fault since I do the cheapest shipping option. It does hurt when I order a large order and get smacked with duty afterwards. When new mood was unavailable to Canada I spoke with a customer service rep and they had mentioned that Canadian distribution would be coming. It sounds like that would end any issues I may have.\\nVery easy to use both times I\\'ve had to get rid of a car.

That is prescription is correct, and no issues noted to date.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMy only wish is that it would be nice if additional discounts were available without having to order four (4) boxes? of lenses at a time.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf reasonable discounts were given on lesser order amounts I would be tempted to order two (2) or more boxes? of contacts at a time.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI am a bit skittish about ordering four (4) boxes? of lenses at a time, should my prescription change while I am in possession of a year or more\\'s worth of lenses.\\nI am still waiting to receive my parcel, however the estimated delivery time has not expired yet.\\nMy biggest concern was that I did not receive a DHL tracking number so that I could check on its progress.\\nConsidering that I paid AUD $ an equivalent amount for both the product and the shipping I would have expected to be able to track my item.\\nWe ordered on 11/30.  On 12/12 tracking said it was delivered but apparently not to us.  It was shipped by FedEx and then transferred to USPS. That is probably where the problem lays. I will start trying to find it today at USPS.\\n\\nThe neighbor brought over the misdelivered package so I updated my review from 1 star to 4 stars.\\nBefore I buy a book anywhere else, I check to see if it\\'s available through Thrift books! Fast,Frugal,Fantastic service.\\nGood competitive price with keys available immediately.\\nI would highly recommend this company to my classmates and co-workers! The stethoscope works wonderfully and the engraving is perfect!\\nI ordered a 40 x 60 print for a room I was preparing for a large gathering.  It arrived on time, but damaged.  iCanvas customer service quickly responded and sent me a replacement.  Unfortunately it did not arrive on time and even more unfortunate was the greater damage on it.  This one had a large gash on the box which pierced through the print!  Needless to say, I was upset.  iCanvas again responded quickly and accommodated my request for a full refund.  So great service, but needs to either improve the quality of their packaging or change their shipping partner.  This frustrating experience was enough to keep me from ordering again. Sorry.\\nYears of trail running and mogul skiing had left my knees in continual pain. When my Ortho doc had no solution and suggested it was time to give up running and skiing, I was devastated. Having heard of stem cell therapy, I made the easy decision to give it a try. My first treatment fall 2015 provided great results with pain free bump skiing that winter. Spring running revealed some dull pain though, so I had a second treatment summer 2016. The result is amazing! I\\'m running and skiing as fast and as hard as ever at 62 years old. This science is very real and incredibly effective.\\nI have a Microsoft LifeCam vx-1000 which I couldn\\'t get to work with windows 8.1 Tried to manually install and also contacted Microsoft with no luck. Driver Support was able to update the drivers and now the web cam works with windows 8.1. So for $9.99 it was worth it. It also updated my realtek audio.\\nYOUR SERVICE IS SATISFACTORY. BUT THE AIRLINE THAT YOU BOOK GETS ONLY A ONE STAR.I SAY THIS BECAUSE THE AIRLINE THAT I WAS BOOKED ON DOES NOT GIVE YOU A OPPORTUNITY TO PICK YOUR SEATS. THE NON-STOP FLT. 6209 TO GATWICK AND 6211 WILL HAVE THE SAME OPTION, THE SEATS WILL NOT OPEN UNTIL ONE OR TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FLIGHT. THAT IS WHAT I WAS TOLD BY 1800FLYEUROPE NOW. NO AIRLINE THAT I KNOW HAS THESE RESTRICTIONS. WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THIS RESTRICTION. I AM BOOKED ON AMERICAN AIRLINES, BUT THE FLT. IS FLOWN BY BRITISH AIRLINES. I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE BRITISH AIRLINES THAT MADE THAT CALL.\\nThanks- we switched from chewy.com to you because they stopped supplying the food we fed our dogs.

What\\'s not to like?!\\nHelpful ADT installer. Like having security.\\nIt was a great experience, no hassle price was better than some other sites thank you TicketCity.\\n2 Cab corners came in box that could have fit 10 or more.

She said she was having trouble with her computer and could not help me. I paid thirty extra dollars to have my order shipped faster. What a joke! It still took several days to get the package.

The application to approval was completed in a matter of about an hour. I was so pleased with the representatives. When they recognized that I was having difficulty with the downloads of some of the documents due to my technical inability, they immediately contacted me to guide me through with the use of my phone. I would definitely recommend RocketLoans to anyone seeking a personal loan.\\nOur kohls account was hacked while making an online purchase. We were told two new cards would be sent. My husband received his but I didn\\'t. I called and was told it would be sent. Still didn\\'t come. Called and asked to talk to a supervisor and was told it hadn\\'t been sent. Since I it was going to take several weeks, my husband tried to activate his and was told it was an invalid number. Asked to speak with the same supervisor and no one knew who she was. Another concern was with recording while I was waiting. It stated yes rewards customers get ten dollars extra bucks on birthday. I found this not to be true. It is randomly determined.\\nCliff was terrific. When Cliff was unable to get the part from his supplier for 10 days, he recommended Amazon. With my Amazon Prime account we had the part in 2 days at half the price.\\nFantastic job on the number I ordered. I must come up with more projects for Craft Cuts.\\nDelivery is fast, which is what makes all the difference to me.\\nLove it! Good quality and customer service!\\nIf you want a review, have the courtesy to call me by my name\\nFast shipping and friendly customer service when I called to inquire about my order.  In regards to the sink protectors sitting too high off the bottom of the sink I took the rubber plastic feet off and they sat in the sink with just enough clearance to make it easy to rinse the sink of food waste and fits my sinks perfectly.  Without the rubber feet in place the metal leaves a sort of dark mark on the stainless but you can\\'t see it with the protector in place and the mark can be removed with a little Bar Keeper\\'s Friend if you end up removing the protector.  I wish I had bought these sooner!  It was a great purchase!\\nI wanted to rent a condo but the person posting the place would not return any emails after several attempts I found another property. I would give 5 stars for that booking and process but went with 4 because of my time spent finding what we want and having contact with the lady. There should be a way Vrbo contacts the listing owner as a 3rd party to confirm they are in this or not. I was mad, why list a property if your not going to rent it out...\\nCame in as expected, in just three days out of the seven, although the box of my purchase aka the cover, the corners were bent, and i like my corners a full 90 degrees.\\nMy experience with Choice Home Warranty was such a pleasure.  The service was quick and efficient and professional.  I\\'m very happy with Choice Home Warranty. The service person that was sent out was knowledgeable, professional and polite.

The staff is responsive.  With one exception, I have pulled up to the valet, immediately a team member arrives at my car, hands me a ticket, takes my keys, grabs my luggage to put into the waiting van.  Doesn\\'t matter the day, time.  Within 10-15 mins of my arrival at Wally Park, I am dropped of at the airline drop off.  Super convenient!  Responsive, professional staff!\\nI am so pleased with the acrylic model ship case I purchased to display a ship my brother made and gave to me as a gift. The quality of the product is superb and the price was the lowest I was able to find. I did much research and was so happy to get such a nice case that was very reasonably priced. My brother makes his own cases for his models and was going to make one for me, but told me he could not make it for the price I found on this website. He could not believe the low price I paid for my display case for the boat he gifted to me! Would definitely buy again for your company. The product arrived very quickly and was packaged very well to prevent any issues as it was a delicate acrylic case with the potential for many issues during the delivery process. Hope my review helps future customers!\\nVery happy with my purchase.\\nWith a name like PartsGeek, you\\'d think these guys would be able to send you the correct part.  Simply input your car make, year, and model and leave it to them to find you exactly what you need.  NOT!  \\r\\n\\r\\nI ordered 2 front rotors for a 2005 Saab 93 Linear.  The PartsGeek website located the part and claimed it was an \"exact fit\".  It wasn\\'t.  They sent 285mm and my car clearly has 302mm.  Now I have to PAY the shipping to send these back to get a refund.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot to mention, good luck trying to contact any person through this company.  No email or phone #\\'s provided.  Poor experience overall.\\nHad an issue with my email address, got it fixed. Thanks Teodora! Fast, easy fix.\\nQuick and easy! They have the, very hard to find, bulb I’ve been looking for!\\nHave ordered several times and each time received what I ordered and usually received earlier than promised.\\nim not recevid my order\\nThe ladies were very pleasant and helpful. Very good customer service. Took the time to explain everything and answer my questions and concerns. They weren\\'t trying to rush me out.\\nAfter about a month I can say the call quality is excellent, both domestic & international. International rates are very competitive, the main reason I chose Phonepower\\n\\nTheir web interface could use some improvements. (1) A faster server. I\\'m spoiled, I like fast servers rather than Phonepowers that takes 15 seconds to respond. (2) Custom Caller ID would be nice - the ability to assign a caller ID to numbers who call me. (3) The ability to block callers by caller ID would be nice rather than block only a phone number as currently available. Telemarketers can & do call from different numbers but they frequently show the same CID. Enough.\\nI absolutely love the DSL Extreme service. Just wish the installation could have been sooner. Definitely worth the wait!\\nIt was fanfuckingtastic\\nI am very happy with product and with shipping speed. I will purchase from here again when need arises.\\nI was very pleased by the professionalism and knowledgeable service I received from Maliah.  She was prompt, very polite and had a good sense of what I was looking to spend and wanted from my trip.   She would respond to questions immediately and based on this I started telling all my friends about Apple and their service teams efforts.\\nPainless experience; good service; prompt delivery; product is good so far...\\nI did not know what to expect when I first phone Select Quote as I was just calling for info after I saw a TV ad.  I cannot put into words how happy my husband and I are with the insurance plans that we were able to obtain.   The process was seamless and  my agent Greg was very professional.  The followup was outstanding.  Thank you so much\\nI like White Mountain Puzzles as they have the hard to find now photo puzzles.  The only thing I don\\'t like like is that the puzzles pieces are larger than usual (why?????) and it makes the puzzle larger than normal 1,000 piece puzzles. Therefore it does not fit on my puzzle board  that my husband made for me. That is my only annoyance that I now have to do it directly on the dining room table when I have a nice puzzle board already.\\nI applied for the loan at 7 AM in the morning.  The fund was in my account by 2 PM the same day.\\nTried tu publish comment from a company i Work with and they erased my comment, where is the free speech? why it needs to go under supervision if what i say is what i want all to know, as I´m sure they will erase this post cause of this bad review.\\nLess expensive than Amazon sellers, easy online shopping set-up, and despite shipping \\'ground\\' my order took less than a week to deliver.

I asked him what I should do.  He suggested the front.  Then I paid and had to sign something stating that I should put them in the rear.\\r\\nThe worst thing he did was kept asking me questions that he shouldn\\'t ask right out of the gate.  A good salesman takes the customer for and enjoyable conversation starting with the current problem, what the options are, and what he recommends.  Then you ask the question.  \\r\\nAt the same time there was a different guy that was a perfect employee.  He spoke properly, remembered me even though I wasn\\'t his customer, seemed knowledgable.  I almost told my salesman to just stop and let me talk to this other guy.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOne last thing.  Tell the bad employee to pull up his pants.  Is that even in fashion any more?\\nall i needed,  very good refresh rate and color depth\\nI like this website because I am a disabled veteran who can\\'t easily get out to buy food for my three cats and I hate finding out that I only have one can or one last bowl of dry food left. Once I get down to half of my supply I am able to order online and know that I will receive my order before I run out. My only complaint is that I use Meow Mix and I did not see it when I went to order it on the web site. Maybe I missed it but I need it so if I can\\'t get it from PetBest I will have to discontinue ordering from them and look elsewhere so I hope I just missed it when I did my first order!

Books were in great shape and arrived rather quickly.\\nI have bought 3 weighted children\\'s blanket. I am very happy with them for they have helped to calm my grandchildren when they get anxious. They are always delivered quickly. The last one I bought was for my grandson, that was his Christmas present. The only thing that went wrong with that is that I ordered a sport ball pattern and got a baseball pattern. So my grandson askes me where are the soccer balls? That is his favorite sport, so he doesn\\'t use it very often. I highly recommend this product , they really do help but just make sure you receive what you ordered.\\nPurchased a couple of varieties of teas, very happy with the quality and price. Fast shipping.\\nThriftbook.com is the ONLY place I buy my books from. If they don\\'t have the book I\\'m looking for I just simply wait. They now have an app that makes my shopping more convenient. Along with a great rewards program. Not to mention free shipping. If your looking for a great reliable company, look no further than Thriftbooks.\\nThere are very few sale sites that deliver constantly on a good selection of products. Touch of Modern has consistently met my expectations on the quality of products and providing something new and cool.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site is easy to use and the pricing and shipping very transparent.\\nThe best experience ever. Its simple and easy not to mention the low price.\\nPart ordered in error, returned and receive a prompt refund.\\nGettington.com has been one of my GOTO online stores for holiday shopping for several years.  Items are top quality, good pricing, and ship promptly.\\r\\nI generally wait for cyber Monday to buy and have everything within a week.  It\\'s hassle-free!\\r\\nThe option of purchase by payment plan has been a life saver. Seriously, when it comes to Christmas presents, Gettington.com has been a LIFE SAVER.\\nI originally prepaid to have a cleaning after a holiday party. I got a reminder 2 hours before the cleaning and then 30 minutes before I was informed it was canceled. They rescheduled it for the following day but I rescheduled it for a week later. It was frustrating.\\r\\nWhen the cleaning did happen, Crystal was my cleaner and she was great. She was very nice and friendly. She happily reworked areas I asked her to pay special attention to and asked me to double check that I was satisfied with other areas.\\nUsed Sky Auction for the first time got immediate phone response to our purchase. The Sky Auction rep took a few special requests we had and within 24-48 hours our reservations were confirmed and everything was as requested. Will definitely use them again especially like the buy it now feature\\nExcellent service. Highly recommended.\\nVery good. I made reservation in one resort, but when we checked in, we found it was not of our taste. Next day I contacted sanswing airlines in Cancun, and they contacted vacation express, I believe, and made arrangement for different resort for rest of our stay. It was such a big relief. Thanks.\\nI have been trying to get into DE shaving for a few months now, and have been looking for a good place to get all of my stuff from. WestCoastShaving really fills that niche for me. They had everything I wanted, plenty of reviews from other members to let me know how their experience was, and a huge assortment of goodies ranging from inexpensive to absolute luxury. Thanks WCS\\nLove the recipes, the ingredients are high quality and excellent instructions!!\\nI was charged $99.99 for an All Shine but upon returning saw that only a portion of the car was cleaned. The Keys were left in it and I presume whomever was in charge thought I might not notice that only a portion of the car was cleaned. After addressing with the Manager and the Representative from All Shine I was assured I would receive a refund  from All shine. That was August 17th and I have yet to receive a refund?\\nI must admit I was nervous ordering a 1.77 carat ring online.  However, the ring is everything Brilliance said it would be.  My fiancé and I have verified the ring is authentic and exactly as advertised.  We took the ring to two different local jewelers.  Both the representatives at the jewelry stores where very impressed with the ring, as are most people that see the ring.  Both of the jewelers told me they couldn’t beat the price I paid for the ring.  I also was able to see the GIA laser inscription under a microscope at the jewelry store.  My fiancé was adamant about not ordering a ring online.  However, the diamond we bought is almost a full carat larger than similarly priced rings we saw at major, name brand jewelry stores.  My fiancé and I couldn’t be happier.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep in mind, rings ordered during the holidays may take a few days longer to be delivered.  GIA laser inscription can take up to ten days; Brilliance has no control over this.  The wait is well worth it. I am a very satisfied customer.\\nI like this company my wig came fast I\\'m very satisfied\\nI wanted to pay using PayPal but was unable to have it work. Otherwise booking was painless.\\nI love going on Houzz to look for inspiration and it such a great reference for my customers so they understand all the creative and beautiful things my company can do for them if they look outside the box and try a new style.

Thank you so much.\\nEasy to follow recipes with quality, simple ingredients make dinner time wonderful around our house! I love the diversity of the recipes and the fact that we could make the same thing later on and all the directions and measurements are still there to recreate that great recipe for friends and family. We are loving cooking again!\\nI wont exaggerate but Trustpilot is very trustworthy. \\r\\nI guess this is the best place if you want legit reviews coming from legit customers because Trustpilot takes a lot of consideration before approving your review.\\r\\n\\r\\nThumbs up to Trustpilot. Please continue the goodness that you are doing :)\\nClassic looking trophy.  Heavy, well-constructed, very well etched.  Better than I expected.

Using video and hearing the natural language gives context and meaning and I find I remember language better that way.\\nMy recent purchase was my third one.  As the first two purchases, my item (ring) is quite beautiful!!  I am happy to recommend \"The Pearl Source\" to everyone!!  This company is such a great company to purchase your pearls!!  Their pearls are wonderful quality!!\\nIt will be great if contract cancellation more quick and easy... :) overall is good..\\nThe process was great!  Smooth and precise!\\nTons of research and a steep learning curve led me to the Clean Water Store. Several phone calls and emails which were answered promptly I chose a product that best suited my purpose (heavy iron contamination of well water) I went with the \"Pro-Ox\" auto black flushing filter with the side tank (chlorine bleach to \"re-gen\" the media) simple and VERY effective. I am using a secondary filtration system purchased elsewhere but between the two water is sparkling and delicious and the pre filter on the secondary system isn\\'t doing the brunt of the labor. Highly recommend calling and talking to the team, it was a very informative and they saved me a considerable amount of money.\\nI\\'ve used BLURB a number of times to make various family history books using narrative, photos and scanned charts.  Everything comes out clear and colorful; the quality of the pages and printing is extremely high.  Once, when I discovered a bug in their new program, they were very concerned and quick about fixing it to make things right.  I will be making BLURB books again and again, and will always recommend BLURB to others.  They do not disappoint.\\nI\\'m very happy with all day chemist.\\nThis was my first time taking a chance and ordering a car part online. I ordered a radiator for my Toyota truck and all was smooth. Although I couldn\\'t get the pay-pal link to work on my phone, I paid direct and the radiator came 4 days later. Very reasonably priced! Midas had quoted me $645 for this job. I bought it here for $120 and my husband installed it. Saved a ton of money!! Very pleased with this first experience and will definitely be a returning customer.\\nI would recommend using Book Renter to any college student.\\nAwesome service, had the part in a couple of days.\\nThe products that are sent are as advertised and at a good price. My problem is that Pure Formulas lists products as available for months when they are not able. I have ordered a particular product from the website on numerous occasions only to have the order cancelled. I would expect the website to be updated to indicate that the product is out of stock or no longer available. The product I need has not been available for months and I keep trying to order it as it is still listed on the website as available.\\nI have been a customer for about 2 years. Western Bike Works has nice website, great selection of products, decent prices, and great customer service. I am very happy with all of my purchases.\\neasy to use for anyone\\nAlways able to find what I need.  Prices are very reasonable\\nquick and easy!\\nIt was easy to book and nice to use\\nThey make everything to order which takes some time. Customer Service is non-existent if you call they don\\'t answer, if you email they won\\'t respond. They need to pull some of that marketing money and put it towards customer service. Overall the product shipped and was good quality so alas, three stars.\\ni think Keep Calling is wonderful, i get alot of mins for a very good price, i love using this company for my international calls & will continue doing so..thank you for a great service!\\nI have had numerous issues with the doorbell camera since having the system installed in February 2017.  Techs have been to my home on several occasions as well many telephone calls with customer support.  I have had the doorbell camera replaced and it still is not what was promised.  The camera is very inconsistent, for example only recording during daylight hours, recording 1 in 5 visitors at various times or nothing at all.  The customer service/support teams are excellent and the techs are very courteous and helpful.  Thankfully I have never had to experience a true emergency, but I trust I would have nothing to worry about.\\nGreat products and great service\\nThe amount charged is over the amount acceptable by australia where efptos can only be 0 to 2.5 percent only.\\nClaim paid fast, work as advertised\\nGreat people, honest\\nGood service, good product\\nI\\'m getting married June 2016 and was needing paper bags for my gifts for my bridesmaid and groomen and it came in a ten pack was great yes there just but its just a gift bag you can buy name tags to add but ship was quick will tell a friend and will order again also\\nI had been looking for the prefect hair accessories for my Bridesmaids for months and months, finally I stumbled across CoverYourHair.com and instantly fell in love!

Thank you all for your express help and keep it up. the fare offered was the best for this flight i simply had to travel on, very neat and professional. Keep it up!\\nPurchased the Mobal unlimited data sim card for my daughter to use on her trip to Amsterdam and it worked perfectly.  Great purchase. Thank you Mobal\\nFor a beginner, this app is very easy to use!\\nNot only am I impressed that a business would flourish to create and supply products that are safe, reliable and of quality materials, but stand on solid ethics and character!!  \\nThank you \"My Green Mattress\":)\\nFinding a hotel nearby was very quick and easy. It was also a lot cheaper than I expected! I didn\\'t expect to see options for rentals after I booked my reservation. I didn\\'t rent through the site because I have corporate accounts with most agencies, but I was shocked to see that the prices were very close to what I rent for with my discount. \\n\\nPriceline is an amazing service and I look forward to booking through them again.\\nBooking was straight forward, airport staff was friendly, fast and provided options for car type. Price was good. Insurance was excessive. The car was clean, nice to drive and was in good condition. Returning it was quick and easy. Thank you.\\nTim - Agent # 30980 - EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL!!! Customer Service at it\\'s BEST!!! I thought REAL Customer Service was a \"forgotten past-time\"...then I met Tim!!! This young man should travel the country (companies should hire Tim) to teach true Customer Service to Customer Service Representative...from small businesses to Fortune 100 Companies. If I owned a company, he would be my Vice President!!! I would want Tim - Agent # 30980 to be the face of my company!!!\\nExcellent service and quick shipping\\nEveryone was always quick to respond and very friendly to work with. No complaints at all- would recommend.\\nHad a lot of problems ordering from the web site. Cart would appear to have items in in, then display as empty when opened. This happened repeatedly until, apparently serendipitously, the problem resolved.\\nJensonUsa has always been quick and reliable for me.  They are the main online retailer for me due to pricing and reliability.\\nNathan, my writer offered a quick turn around with  very professional and outstanding end result.  He was courteous and very knowledgable. I am very satisfied with the finalized Resume, and didn\\'t realize just how crappy my original was!\\nWanted to get a loan....  Swift Capital held to its name.  SWIFT .. no hassles...  funded quickly and Customer Rep Kristin was very helpful.\\nKabbage cared about my needs not just about making money.

Fast forward to a few months before the wedding . . . out of time and over-budget.  Our wedding planner recommended using Minted.  It was fast and the paper quality is impressive!  I\\'m really pleased.  Plus, they\\'ll address your envelopes for free.  BONUS!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only two things I\\'d caution about (but still with my full recommendation of Minted):  if you order envelope liners, you have to assemble them yourself.  Not so fun after the first 10!  And designs aren\\'t as customizable as presented . . . you get a little leeway, but not full control.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, Minted!\\nI originally tried to place my order on line but had difficulty getting it to process. I called customer service and was helped very promptly and politely. My order arrived when I was told it would. Best prices on dog food I\\'ve found and food was fresh.\\nI ordered 3 custom shirts and one wasn\\'t done properly. There was several missing alphabets on the shirt\\nAn excellent buying experience. The trees are great specimens and arrived very well packed.\\nI was searching the internet for prices on supplements and came across Supplement Warehouse.  they had the best prices - and free shipping - and they had a lot of free stuff that came with the order.  I was impressed and continued to search their site for other items I can buy from them.\\nI was very pleased with how easy it was to order and we received the dress in a week! The fit was perfect but I wasn\\'t worried since they offer free exchanges. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.\\nIt was a gift, and she loved it! Quick delivery.\\nI hesiated for days before ordering from your company but today I am glad to realize that your service is excellent. I will continue working with you. Congratulations!\\nThe stamps were very nice and the design turned out good.\\n                     Thanks'"
