    "Sometimes scraping tasks demand interactions (e.g. login, scrolling, clicking), and a no XHR data can be found easily, so you need the browser to execute the scripts before you can get the data. XHR is short for XMLHttpRequest - a JavaScript API - like the one we found in the jobnet.dk exerise.\n",
