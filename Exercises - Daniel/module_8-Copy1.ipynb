    "Sometimes scraping tasks demand interactions (e.g. login, scrolling, clicking), and a no XHR data can be found easily, so you need the browser to execute the scripts before you can get the data. XHR is short for XMLHttpRequest - a JavaScript API - like the one we found in the jobnet.dk exerise.\n",

      "Made an online reservation.  A week later I get a cancellation out of the blue.  The explanation is that the facility \"has requested to put a hold on reservations\", whatever that means.  Good thing it didnt happen the day before I was supposed to arrive.I was offered a $5 off coupon for my trouble.  An appropriate response would be to reimburse me the difference between what it will cost me now and the prepaid amount I originally contracted.  No.  None of that.  Company is probably run by a bunch of 20 somethings who have never been taught the concept of accountability.\n",

A week after the expected arrival date, I logged in to CafePress to see why they hadn't come, and my order showed as cancelled.

      "The customer service representative I spoke to was very pleasant, but she could not do anything to reinstate my order. She said she would put in a ticket to some other group that could and told me they would call me within 24 hours. 24 hours later, no call, so I called back. Spoke to the exact same very nice CSR, who gave me a phone number for this mysterious other group. Called the number, it went straight to voicemail. Left a message with my phone and email. Next day, still no call back. Called again, straight to voicemail again, left another message. No response. \n",

      "I purchased 2 balloon bouquets and a flower bouquet for my mother across country when I found out she was admitted for and emergency surgery. It was the least I could do considering my husband and I are stationed with the military in .CA and my mother was in NC. Balloons were perfect, the flowers appeared nothing like the bouquet I ordered. So of course I contacted the customer service line, after sending pictures of the bouquet my mother received and going back and forth all day, I was finally told it was going to be made right and that my mother would receive a bouquet the following day that appeared more like what I ordered, so the next morning my mother received it and guess what still appeared nothing like what I ordered as far as the colors the bouquet was supposed to be. So I contacted customer service again, sent another picture, mind you up until this point everyone I had spoken to had been so understanding and polite. I went on about my day, while at a class with my son received a voicemail telling me they were more than likely not going to refund my money after the second flower delivery attempt but that I could call back to discuss the situation, so i called to speak with the young lady who had just left me a voicemail. Well the phone was answered but I never got a hi how are you today or anything of that nature but rather over heard the young lady who had just left me a voicemail and a gentleman discussing the emails I had sent and laughing about my request to refund my flower purchase because it was not delivered properly 2 days in a row. They were mocking the situation, I said hello many times this occurred for about 3 to 4 minutes, finally I hung up and called back and asked for a manager or supervisor, turns out the young lady who had left me a voicemail was in fact the person mocking and attempting to make a fool out of me, and the gentleman who was with her I was told was the owner. I was furious at this point, I told the girl how I felt and that what they had done was very unprofessional and disrespectful. We spoke for a good 25 minutes going back and forth and finally made peace with the situation, apologized to each other and she told me to give it 2 to 3 days and that our flower purchase would be refunded. So again I continue on about my day when all of the sudden I get a phone call from a .CA number, thinking it's my son's Dr. I answer, and a lady named Cynthia with the company was on the other end, yelling at me and being incredibly disprespcrful to me about a situation I thought had already been resolved, upon her yelling and rudeness I asked he why she felt the need to call and yell at me when she wasn't even completely sure of the situation at hand which she then responded that I needed help and she hung up on me. I was in awe and shock. How amazing it was that this company is in the business of lifting individuals spirits when their families have loved ones in hospitals, to be treated with such rude disrespectful behavior makes me feel as if they are unworthy of the money their customers pay them to have a job. I did reconnect with the customer service line and speak to the so called owner, he said he was going to use this situation as a teachable moment for his team and I hope that is true because no one should have to go through the same situation as me. Needless to say, I will no longer use this business in the future.\n",

It was not exactly what we had planned due to the fact that the restaurant said it would be too difficult for the waiters to serve the dinner if we moved around. However, the facilitator and his assistants did a fantastic job in adjusting the activity and kept all of us right on time.  The activities they had for us were a lot of fun and very engaging for the entire group.  This group is very competitive, so that made it even that much better.

The real problem though is how long it takes to ship, make sure you give yourself a good 20+ days to receive any product from them. Most online retailers ship right away and I've found it takes almost 8 days for them to ship a t-shirt, not worth it! I ordered a sweater from Tipsy Elves the same night I ordered a t-shirt from Threadless and it was delivered 5 days before the Threadless t-shirt even shipped.\n",

      "Expedia charged me over $50 for a so-called \"Travel Protection Plan\".  But when I had to cancel my flight due to unforeseen circumstances, I was told that I couldn't get a refund unless there is a death in the family or there's a medical condition for which there has to be a note from a doctor to show that the traveler is unable to travel.  So, prospective travelers, unless you do expect a death in your family or some serious medical conditions during your planned travel, don't spend a penny on that useless \"travel protection plan\", and better yet, don't use Expedia for your travel needs.  Instead, contact the airlines, rental car companies, and hotels directly.  With those merchants, you tend to have greater flexibility.\n",

So I called. I was then given a date a couple weeks away. When that date came and went I called again. I was told that the item had arrived (why was I not contacted?) and because it had been over 30 days since my original order, it would have to be re-ordered. So we did that, and as the customer service rep was about to hang up, I asked if the original payment was still able to be used. He checked, and sure enough, needed the info again since it had been so long. \"Good thing you said something,\" he replied. \r\n",

I really like the clothing line displayed and the discounts are great, but when I've received items that I've worn once (torn), ordered pants (very cheap metal zipper - the kind that rust after 1st wash), cotton count (where you can see through the skirt), etc. I still shop at Tobi as you can find some unique items but only when on major discount or sale.\n",

      "George and the team at Playlist Push have been great!  Very transparent and responsive!  When we started the campaign we spoke with George the founder himself, he explained their methods and the best practices for his platform to help see greater success.  He was honest about the fact that success in a campaign like this is ultimately up to the strength of the song, but his platform will guarantee that curators at least listen and thoughtfully consider your song.  Spotify promo is a difficult business to be in because there are a lot of horror stories but if you only take one thing from this review it should be this: Playlist Push will do exactly what they say they're going to do.  In a world of over-promising and under-delivering that alone can be refreshing.\n",

      "You can choose to pitch to multiple playlist genres, dance/indie rock/folk/pop etc., and the people who see the most success usually do two or three. For our first time out of the gate we just went with a single genre, because you pay per genre and we were looking at this as our test case. Our campaign saw a growth of over 400% on our monthly listeners and even after the campaign ended our song is still enjoying rapid growth.  The curators provided feedback on why they did or did not choose the song and I was able to understand the thought process.  \n",

Though I definitely won't purchase a necklace from Cafe press again, I will not hesitate to buy something else from them.  Great customer service.\n",

      "Like I said,  the price of the products I ordered were great, quality not so much....I have a creaky ball joint on an upper control arm in my acura TL '03, 2-3 months after it was replaced with a partsgeek part....In reading much of their disclaimers it seems the are fine with selling cheap parts just not backing up what they sell.....Customer service is non existent......you have to email a ticket in for any kind of a response that \"usually takes 24 - 48 hours\"....not what I want to deal with when I have a complaint and want to talk to someone about a resolution....On the off chance that I might get someone on the phone I spent about 1/2 an hour on hold listening to the same crappy music and no one ever answered, my feeling was that no one would and I'd still be on hold at this very moment....In all they've lost my business and I'll buy parts elsewhere.\n",

      "Great area, great facility and great staff. Wayne was awesome!\n",
      "JustFab has an amazing selection of shoes and their customer service is amazing! The only thing that I would change would be the fact that you can't choose the same subscription of offered magazine and if you choose a subscription and then don't end up getting it delivered, you can't choose it again so that kind of sucks. But all in all, Just Fab has quality products and an amazing return policy also. I love it!!\n",
      "I have used Postsnap on several occasions now and I am very impresssd with the quality of their product and their service. The website is very easy to use and the cards are usually posted within 24-48 hrs. In this time of text, emails, twitter etc, people rarely receive things through the mail so the recipients of the cards have been thrilled to receive them. The thing I especially love is its no inconvenience to me. No sorting through postcards, no finding a post office or letterbox, no buying stamps. I can sit on the beach sipping a pina colada, whilst going online to Postsnap.  Choose the card, upload my chosen photos, write a few words click send. The price includes the postage and, because the cards are printed and posted in the UK, they arrive within more or less the next day. Perfect!\n",
      "Its in their name: Thrift Books. I was looking for the most affordable offer online and I'm so glad I found Thrift Books. Not only do they offer a wide range of book selections that I'm looking for, its also the cheapest with the best shipping & handling deal I've found. Upon ordering two books, they ask if it was ok to upgrade one book that was in \"acceptable condition\" to \"good condition\" at no extra charge just because it was most eco-friendly and efficient. Received my books in time and in good condition. Companies that take the extra step to be considerate and environmentally-aware show me they have ethics and values past just making a dollar. They have my trust and is my go-to when checking for books to purchase online.\n",

      "Very easy to make money with. Every once in a while I will complete a survey and will not receive the points for it and have to contact the help desk. Also I don't like most of the offers I get in my inbox because you go through and do what they say but don't get rewarded for them. Seems like jumping through hoops. also the discover offers, some of them are the same way. Overall, this is a legit and easy way to make money on the side.\n",

      "I like their mission. In a time when my husband and I are trying to rebuild our lives and credit, it is much a appreciate to have a company giving us a chance to do so without the best credit. However, their customer service is a little bit unprofessional and some of their practices are not customer friendly. Such as giving me a due date for payments of every other thursday, but I get paid on Friday. I wrote them about it instantly, weeks before the first payment and they said it could not be changed. Only two payments at a time. very annoying.  But they allow you to build credit with them and lower your interest rates as well as higher loan amounts which is more than what could be said by other companies.\n",

      "I recently purchased a 'desktop replacement' laptop through XoticPC and I have to say they are far and above the best of the best. I wont name any other names, but I had gone through 5 other companies to try and purchase a similar laptop. Trying to find a group of people who could give me a straightforward and honest idea of what I was going to end up spending, the timeframe of when I would receive my laptop, etc. All 5 gave me the runaround, and then XoticPC came through with flying colors. I honestly wish I could give them 6/5 stars because they even dealt with my terrible attitude I had left over from the other 5 companies being so false and impossible to deal with. Even with that, they kept their cool, reassured me, and dealt with me kindly and professionally through the whole process. I will not buy another custom built system from another company. Hands down. Bravo to the last internet company to provide old fashioned, timely, and honest customer service.\n",
      "When I called they had me with an agent forover 30 minutes. The gentleman was clueless, kept having to put me on hold. Then he screwed up the transaction and when I called back, i was on hold for 3 minutes and then someone picked up but never answered. You could hear the discussion in background. They are clueless on how to operate a call center. Zero customer focus.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "Last year, I ordered a product that took about a month to arrive with no communication about the delay from Skinstore. When the product finally arrived, it wasn't the one I ordered, nor was there was anything written on the box to indicate that it was from Skinstore. There was no invoice or anything written inside that said Skinstore. Just a random product. I was scared to open it in fact, and when I tried to communicate with Skinstore, I received automated messages in return. No one picked up the customer service phoneline even though it was well within the listed hours. I didn't understand why I was trying so hard to reach them when I wasn't even sure this random product was from Skinstore. It took another few weeks to resolve this issue because the web interface wouldn't allow for attached images. To skip ahead in this process, I was offered $5 off or something ridiculous for a 2 month drawn out process.\n",

There was a problem with the Vacation Express (Nexxus?) person who was not where he or she was supposed to be (for hours) to let us know when the shuttle would be picking us up, and we spent a fair amount of time trying to find this simple but essential bit of information.  We would have preferred to be spending our last day on the beach, relaxing, instead of pursuing someone who did not show up for work.  The hotel itself was extraordinary.  This was our 7th Mexico (Cancun or Riviera Maya) trip with Vacation Express and one of the best places to stay.  We have nothing but praise for the hotel.\n",

      "I've always had a very easy time dealing with Doheny's and use them at the start and close of our pool season for the last 4 years without question.  This was an anomoly - the first time that we had any issue.  Apparently there was an issue with my credit card on this particular order - we're all human and it happens.  My issue is that Doheny's made no effort to contact me to inform that there was a problem.  Instead, the order just sat \"in process\" until I called 5 days later to find out why I hadn't received it yet.  That's when I was informed that there was a problem with the payment.  I gave them the number again by phone and it went thru immediately, but the fact remains that if I hadn't called, it would still be sitting and waiting.  Just have to believe that there is some step in their order process where they could/would note orders that were submitted but had some sort of issue and that they would then reach out to the buyer to get the order finished and shipped out...\n",

I typed in the requested information regarding my vehicle, ie; year, make, model etc., and the PartsGeek website indicated which AC Delco parts kit I needed.

PartsGeek is willing to refund my money upon me returning the filter kit.  It will cost me $14.95 to ship the kit back. The problem is the PartsGeek website is flawed and not detailed enough to make sure customers are ordering the correct parts.  I own four vehicles and do all my maintenance myself.  I order all the time from Rock Auto, Summit and A1 Auto.  Never had a problem with them.  Not sure I'll give PartsGeek another chance.\n",

Having said that, the information that WAS given was very helpful in figuring it all out.  More important was the fact that someone called me within just a couple hours of placing my order to go over an issue with me.  I don't expect they call everyone, but I had a large order and there was a slight issue that they resolved with me.  I was very impressed.  I received everything when it was expected and it was packaged well with no damage etc.  And I felt the prices were very good.

      "I am an artist and worked in a custom framing gallery for many years. Since then I've been framing at home and have found American Frame to have great products and service. I love that I can order up to 5 free sample frame profiles with each order. It makes my process go smoothly. I've also had help with the reps when I'm confused about how to stack frames or add a liner. The two things I wish would change: 1) I use a point driver to secure my frames, but with every frame order I get a baggie with clips and screws. I end up tossing the clips and have a huge collection of screws. It's very wasteful on their part. I wish I could have the option to have those included or not. 2) I like to float artwork on an uncut bottom mat and then have a top mat opening. In the order process you can't order both an uncut mat and a cut mat. Instead I have to go to just the mat board section and select that particular color, cut to size. However the size has to be exactly perfect to what they trim it down to. An 8x10 isn't always just that. But over all, I will continue to order products and I'm a satisfied customer.\n",

Also recommended was replacement on one HDD as it was ‘ailing’.  Told their sales rep that, as noted in cover with order, I was using Rockbox and not Itunes on units, and there was plenty of music on the units.  Also, I had never had a problem with the HDDs on the units.  The rep started the unit with the alleged HDD problem via rockbox and on the phone and he confirmed unit was working and could see music files.  So HDD was working when it got there. \r\n",

      "I then had over a month of trying to find out from the staff why they were only repairing one unit?  They kept saying I had “declined repairs” and but I could never find out why they were not replacing the logic board.  When that was finally cleared up, after phone calls and many emails, and I got the units back: First, my 230 gig drive was reformatted, expressly against my request.  It took the better part of a week for me to restore it, a lot of unnecessary time and effort, wasted.  Second, the other unit I cannot access the drive at all and I guess that was reformatted too.  Had I known this would be the result I would have skipped both repairs.  Third the unit that was repaired and ‘fully functional’ now has problems with the navigation wheels; problems which did not exist before.  I contacted customer service and even wrote a letter to the Mission Repair CEO and received NO REPLY/\r\n",
      "Mission Repair has caused me a lot of delay and aggravation and left me with the units in worse way, in some ways, that before.  I finally took the unit with the problematic HDD to a local place and had it fixed in about 2 hours; I am still having problems with the navigation wheel on the other unit.\n",
      "Just like the \"old fashioned\" local hardware store that are nearly extinct - but online.  I ordered a couple of hinges online one afternoon.  Got a call the next morning to tell me that the item is not in stock and it will be several weeks before it's re-stocked.  I was working with a deadline.  He suggested that I try a larger size that they had but it would not work with the door I had.  He then suggested that I use another brand (well known name) that they had in stock with the finish and size I needed.  I recognized the name and thought it would be more expensive (it was) but was told that because it was their mistake in their inventory system that they would give it to me at the same price as the original but not in stock - hinges.  Because of the deadline I had I was worried about the timing as I had already lost a day.  I was shocked when I received it via Fedex within a few days.  'm sure they lost money on this sale.

The shape and color were as described and looked like the picture but I was not expecting the irridescent shine on all of the pieces.

They later did acknowledge receipt and advised that the repair was being done. Just a few hours later they advised the repair was finished and overnight shipment was done. (Amazing )  By the promised time I received the package from FEDEX and opened it to find 1/2 a phone. No back, battery, SIM card , or micro SD. What? How can this happen?? They did respond to the service contractor and eventually ( 2 weeks later) I received a new back &  battery. After I complained, I finally received a micro sd. Not wanting to wait this long, this all happened after I bought all the  replacement parts. So, they did eventually come through, but much too late. Not to mention that I did lose all my data from the original sd micro. \n",

It is so convenient to have my order delivered to my front door where I can pour it right into their containers on wheels with minimal lifting required!  The time it saves me to just go on line and place my order, rather than go to the pet store is priceless!  They have great prices and service, I tell everyone I know with animals about PetFlow (they have a referral program, but I would rather that money go towards the various causes they help with in disasters, etc...)\n",

There was no warning of any kind that i could see about this prior to placing order. The reason that they do this is so they can say that if anything happens to ur stuff while sitting on ur door step they dont have to help u out ( isnt this what insurance is for). They told me that they wouldnt refund my money due to the ingraving. Well folks as long as u paid with a credit card and ur purchase was more then $50 you can call up ur cc com and tell them thr item never showed up so u just tell them to do a charge back and they take the money back from them and credit ur credit  card and u get ur money back\n",

      "After 5 years, my secretary/receptionist decided to give me 1 week notice she was leaving. I panicked and put an posted an ad for a receptionist. After reviewing over 300 resumes in a 24 hour period and interviewing 6 people, I decided to check out a \"virtual receptionist\". I checked around and then called Servcorp at their Irvine office. I spoke to both Bow and Erika. I decided to go with them for a trial period and now, after just a little over 30 days, I cannot be happier. Both are very professional and Bow answers my calls very professionally. She screens my calls for me and if I do not want the call at that time or I am out, the call goes to my voice mail, which in turn sends me an email with a voice message attached so I can listen to the message. After their normal hours (M-F 8:30-5:30), the calls go straight to my voicemail, which Bow very professionally recorded. And the best thing of all, I am saving over $20,000 a year on not having to pay an employee. I actually spoke to my prior receptionist a few days ago and she is not happy where she is working now and looking for a new job again. I think she wanted her job back, which I would have given her had I not found Servcorp. So happy with their services!\n",

Just after accepting the order, I realized that I didn't choose the express shipment option (which is in my opinion not clearly visible), and I sent an e-mail to orders-HD-individuals@springer.com, asking if it were possible to change the shipment option or, at least, to know if the books would arrive in one week, to be able to react and place a new express order.  One and a half day after, I received an apparently automatic response telling  \"Please be informed that upon checking on our system, we could no longer change the address as well as the mode of shipment since the book was already delivered on June 6, 2014\" , a wrong date, before the order date, which was really sent on June 10 according to the invoice and, what is worst, no answer to my question about the delivery time.

They did not deliver next day and when they did the driver delivered to the wrong address and had an unauthorised signature for the goods. I got to know about wrong delivery via a third party.  Trustpilot would not publish my review because I could not provide evidence!\r\n",
      "My contract was with supplier of goods who were excellent. The intermediary, the delivery company, was at fault. \r\n",
      "Trustpilot customer service still reject my review even though I have emailed the explanation that I did not have a bill from the delivery company. However the delivery company did admit fault in an email to me but Trustpilot would not accept that as evidence. They insist on a PDF or copy of a bill that I do not have. \r\n",
      "Trustpilot response to my first critical review of them was a churn out of their terms. They do not appear to accept that customers are able to make comment on a third party acting as agents for the seller and that you would not be able to provide a PDF bill for their terrible service.\n",

      "I had posted a 3 star review ... see below ... But I am amending my view of this company on account of their great customer service and stellar plant guarantee. I will definitely shop with them again...and with confidence that if I have ANY problems that the folks in customer service will really pull through! Great job! Great company!!   OLD REVIEW---I regularly shop by mail order for my garden plants, so I have experience with this type of business. Of 25 plants ordered, only ten were in good condition upon arrival. 3 were badly damaged by improper packing, 1 more was broken at the base and was beyond survival. The plants clearly had not been watered for some time ahead of shipping and arrived in very stressed condition. They were immediately unpacked, watered and put in a dappled shade situation to allow to recover from shipping shock, which took five days rather that the usual two or so. Still, in total, 5 plants did not survive. I can not recommend this company.\n",

      "very difficult to communicate with when you have an issue. Several times they have made \"upgrades\" and I have been unable to view both of my properties (2) online for weeks or months. Getting an appointment is difficult unless you are willing to wait weeks. They make appointments and don't show up. Their service people are great when they come. Their equipment is dependable.\n",

      "I have used this company for personal trips in the past and never had a problem; however I have now used them twice for corporate travel and both times the driver was late, this last time almost 25 minutes late. In both instances, the driver said they found out the pickup time 15 minutes in advance and couldn't possibly be to me in 15 minutes from the location they were in when they got the call. So it seems to me to be a dispatch problem (?). I don't know. This time I almost missed my train, it was very close.\r\n",

      "THIS TIME, my driver drove an entire block the wrong way down a 1-way street. My head was initially in my phone and I looked up when I heard a slot of honking and people were waving at him.  Really?  Even if you're not familiar with your area or a specific street, you need to follow street signs. He didn't seem to think this was a problem as he turned the car around and proceeded to take me out of my way for another 10 minutes. The driver didn't seem to be able to get out of his own way. He wasn't familiar with the streets and although I tried to provide him with directions, he wasn't able to follow them.\r\n",

Somehow it ended up in the hands of postNL, a Netherlands based carrier.  Their last tracking update was 8 days ago.  I contacted HK and asked to cancel the order and give me a refund.  They said they could not do that until 40 days had elapsed and the shipment still not arrived.  Absolutely unacceptable considering it was shipped \"Air Mail\"!\n",

For 2 weeks YODEL didn't deliver my parcel. This is the worst company ever, everyone I know had the same bad experience with them as me. On the tracking website at first I got the information that they've missed me and left a card. They couldn't miss me cause it's open all day, and there was no card for me or whatsoever. I rearranged the delivery day, they didn't come again. So I rearranged again and picked address automatically, wrote down only postcode and all the rest chose automatically from the box. Next day I got the text message on the that parcel has been delievered succesfully through the letterbox and its been signed. Literelly I've been sitting at work, behind the desk when i got the text, in front of the door.. no one came there. Theres no letterbox.. 2 big doors made of glass, no letterbox anywhere. Is it some kind of joke ? I called YODEL, asking wheres my parcel, they said it was a mistake and the lady said courier has the parcel today and it'll be deliever today. No one came.. After that I coudn't rearrange delivery again because in the system my parcel has been delivered. DO NOT CHOOSE THIS COMPANY ! WAIST OF TIME !

      "Our cat only eats Earthborn Naturals chicken soft food.  We use to purchase it locally from a pet store in our town, but it became increasingly difficult for them to keep it in stock.  Out of desperation to find this food, I searched online and found that PetFlow not only had it, but offered free shipping AND auto ship.  This has been such a lifesaver so that we never run out of food for our kitty.  Very happy with PetFlow!\n",

I recommend to family and friends.\n",
      "Have used them several times now. When first opened they were great, now the experience is mediocre at best. Long times to check out, even longer for your car to be pulled up. All though you fill out all the info booking on line, you have to wait in line to give all the information all over again to be hand written. Have gotten the same employee on drop off the last three times. Acts like he is doing you a royal favor by accepting your information and keys. He was almost done and my husband asked the shuttle bus to wait a minute and the driver said he couldn't. We got on the next one and the driver said we would leave in 5 minutes. Then he disappeared. When he got near again, I asked him when we were leaving as it had been over 5 minutes and he actually denied he said that! He wanted to wait for another couple who were at the check in desk.  Only go back because its cheaper.\n",

The Gate was open, our office was open and we didn't even see their truck pass by or pulled over our vicinity for them to conclude that it was close. Their customer service are very inefficient in handling this complaints too and couldn't even resolve the problem. All they can do is apologize without even taking action to resolve the case.

      "I asked Galahotels via e-mail if the hotel has a parking. They wrote, Yes, they have a private parking but I need to connect to the hotel and ask how I can enter. When I arrived I was driving 20 minutes around the hotel because there was'n any place to stop my car. In the meantime I tried to call them but nobody answered the call. Then finally I could park in the front of the hotel and asked the reception. There is no garage just a public parking about 500 meters away. (Where I could not pay by credit card and needed to change some money.) Finally I could check in the hole. It was about 1,6 x 4 meters. Harry Potter had something similar in the movie under the stairs. In the evening I tried to work. They have free \"high speed\" internet up to 128 kB/sec, which is a joke. Of course it did not work at all. Maybe this hotel is good for backpack tourists because of its central location and relative low price but surely not for business purposes. In the past I had only good experience with Ramada but now I will not use it for a while. :-(\n",

The salesman promised that those patient's whose insurance we don't take would not be billed to us.  Yet once we signed up and gave them our credit card it was a completely different story.  I recently stopped receiving emails from them so I called to find out why and they insisted that it was a problem on my end.

      "They delivered on what they promised.  I could log on /off whenever I wanted. I liked the fact that they quizzed me after each section, so the material was fresh in my mind; and for the most part the final contained the material from the quizzes.  Even though no one likes to review this information I did learn a few things, especially about new laws.

After I purchased the non-refundable tickets, I discovered that Jet Blue has direct non-stop flights from LAX to Lima and from Lima to Fort Lauderdale, for hundreds of dollars less than I paid.

      "The website was very easy to navigate. I bought two Littmann classic III stethoscopes, one for my wife and one for myself. One was the black tubing with black bell and the other was the raspberry tubing with rainbow bell. I had them both laser engraved too. I took about 5-6 days from order placement to arrival at my house. The quality of the stethoscopes are amazing. I can hear so much better and pick up subtle changes that I couldn't hear in my old off brand stethoscope. Medisave kept me updated every step of the way from order placement ti shipping. I feel the price of the stethoscopes, the engraving, and the shipping were very competitive.  Everything went as expected. I do like how the took the extra step to require signature for USPS to deliver at my house, but I wish it was more clear up front that a signature was required. I have a delivery lock box on my porch but USPS didn't leave it and I had to go down and pick it up. Otherwise it was a great experience. I would definitely buy from medisave again in the future should I need to buy another stethoscope.\n",

Even the most obscure title I've been looking for has been located on this site.

I think it's great that you can get a kit -- frame, acrylic, and backing board -- for any size you order; that simplifies things and it's much easier than having to buy each piece separately. And they even sent a print catalog with my order! The frames went together quickly, and look great. \r\n",

The representative was very nice and explained everything very well. I had read reviews where people said they were asked for all these things and  then were not approved. I was fearful of that happening and then so elated when I got my approval. I would definitely recommend them to anyone needing a quick loan.\n",

I called Customer Service to explain that I wanted another 100 bags but found the postage to be prohibitive.  I am the Infantwear Buyer for the Assistance League of Austin and package onesies in the small baggies for donating to at-risk and under-served preemies and infants at Dell Children's Hospital.  The person I spoke with graciously offered to send another package for $2 shipping.  I appreciated that very much but then wondered why the original shipping was $7.25 if the product could be shipped for $2.  For the additional $5.25 that I paid the first time, I could've had another 100 bags for $4 with a little left over!  That would've been great!  Since I am spending the Assistance League's money, I am especially aware of extra spending.  Thank you for a good product and fast shipping, but not the $7.25 shipping cost!\n",

I live in a small town and own a small corner lot. Until they get to a point where you can shrink the radius down, this is more built for people with a large plot of land.

If there are two color options for an item, the boring black one will be the one available in a wider range of sizes, and the fun, cool one is the one that has a much more narrow range of sizes available.  I appreciate that they attempt to recognize more bodies, but we're still withheld from some of the best stuff.  Most everything I want is only available to size XXL instead of 3X and so I have to settle for what I can find in my size.

The listing did not indicate this, and I would not have purchased them otherwise, as it is not convenient for me to go to BB&B store.

The staff on site didn't know how to fix it and wouldn't take the obvious course of action to remedy the situation quickly—delete me from the system and re-enter all info from scratch.

At the same time, my wife was still using the old app and hesitant to switch because of my problems.

I told them I wasn't—that it was $150 more than the listed price and I had seen cheaper tickets elsewhere. I said I understand their dilemma but they stated the price as $270 and I bought the ticket with that understanding. He told me he couldn't honor the listed price because they can't afford that much of a loss, but he could offer a price of $370 and, as a gesture of goodwill, a coupon code for $100 off my next ticket order with them. I said that'd be okay by me. Fast forward a few weeks and I'm buying my next ticket. He'd instructed me that I would have to contact customer service to give them the coupon code. So I do so, and the customer service agent tells me that the code is only good for $10—because the tickets are already discounted, and the code is only worth $100 on non-discounted tickets. Mind you, there's nothing on the website to indicate any of this. And the website is called bargainair...aren't all of their tickets discounted? Isn't that the primary purpose of this company? If they weren't discounted, why wouldn't I just buy them from the airline? After a frustrating hour talking to him, they still refused to honor the coupon they gave me. Instead, as another 'gesture of goodwill,' he offered to let me use the code as if it was a gift card balance—apply $10 off now, and have the remaining $90 to use on future flights. I told him no thank you—at this rate it would take me 5 years to use up this discount. I bought tickets from another website instead, where they were $20 cheaper than the price offered on bargainair.\n",

I would highly recommend this company, they are by far the best in the industry.  Thanks!\r\n",

      "Christmas Eve: With friends & family staying with us for the holidays we placed an order online for local restaurant. Grubhub charged me for food, gave delivery time and sent a confirmation email with “tracking” link.\n",
      "We waited. I checked via their tracking tool and the delivery time had not changed even when the order was 30 minutes late. I then checked Grubhub online and was instructed to call the restaurant. Restaurant has excellent reputation and track record for excellent service and food. Restaurant informed me that they are not affiliated with Grubhub and were closing soon. I then called Grubhub back. Agent contacted restaurant and gave me the only information she could find, “we had been charged and our order would not be coming”.\n",

The website is otherwise very slick (good), it simply would not let me enter the correct street suffix and city name/zip.\n",

One small cabinet was missing holes for shelf pins on one side!\n",

      "I reserved a unit early on a Monday morning. The process online was super easy and quick. I received a call shortly after from my local Life Storage center that I could come by anytime that day before closing (6 PM) to get my keys - no other information given.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I was also planning on moving in that same day. I borrowed two trucks from friends and hired a babysitter to watch our son while my husband and I loaded up all of my stuff to be moved in. We show up to Life Storage at 1:30 PM to grab the keys and move everything in, but as a surprise to us, the offices were closed. They had a sign on the door saying they were all out for lunch and would be back in an hour. I was quite annoyed because there was no mention that they'd be closed for lunch in the phone call I received (he said I could come by anytime before 6 PM). And now we had 2 truckloads of boxes that had to be taken back and unloaded so we could get the trucks back and we had to go pick up our son as the sitter could only keep him until 2 PM. \n",
      "\n",
      "After going through all of that hassle, I did not want to lose my unit so later that afternoon I ran by the center to sign the contract and get my keys (still not sure when I will ACTUALLY be able to move in). \n",
      "\n",
      "I show up and casually let the guys at the front desk know that I was a bit frustrated because I had shown up earlier in the day to move in and no one was here and it caused a huge hassle for us. The guy at the front desk did not even acknowledge me. Not even an apology. He literally ignored that I had said anything and just asked me for my drivers license. \n",

      "It didn't seem worth causing a scene so I just moved along with the check-in process. A few minutes later he asked me when I was planning on moving in, and I told him I didn't know anymore because we just had to take all of my stuff back and unload it and had to take the trucks we borrowed back because they were closed when we showed up. Again, he COMPLETELY ignored me. Didn't even acknowledge that I said anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "I get that things happen. The fact that they were closed for an hour during the middle of the day when I was told I could come anytime was annoying, but it happens. But to completely ignore a customer who is voicing a complaint is just bad business. At best I was hoping to have the $25 administrative fee waived for our trouble and at the very least I thought I would get an apology. I got neither. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, the storage center seems nice, clean, and functional. Just call ahead before showing up to make sure someone will in fact be in the office (even if they said they will). Having to move is already a stressful event in itself, so this bad customer experience made it even worse. \n",

      "I don't like to leave negative reviews but I feel it is necessary to share the bad experience I have had from One.com - particularly after attempting a resolution and instead receiving a confrontational exchange from one of the (so-called) managers on the live chat desk. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I will try and keep my story brief but basically I set up a website for a friend a while ago for her new company. A little while after setting it up, we both attempted to request that the ownership information was changed into her name and company name - mainly for accounting purposes. However, I kept receiving the bills and was sent a couple of reminders, including interest incurred. Upon attempting to contact One.com by email (you can only do this online, so no telephone option), I did not hear anything back to confirm my previous requests had been received to change ownership. Instead, today I received an email from a debt collection company demanding the account is settled within 7 days. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After speaking to a very helpful person at Intrum Justitia Ireland Ltd. debt collectors, I was advised to speak to One.com to resolve, via their Live Help Desk (as the best option) to try and resolve and to have the collection order rescinded, considering the circumstances. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In short, after a protracted conversation with one team member, which transpired that One.com only changed the domain name registration, not the webspace registration, I requested the case was reviewed by a manager. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They in no uncertain terms told me that because they had apparently sent me a 'handover' form, they would not be willing to either resend the form or set up the change of ownership (despite me not receiving such a form) and instead I would have to settle the account with the debt collectors, because otherwise \"they would have to burden any costs of withdrawing\" their claim to the debt collectors. Upon challenging this further, I was met with very curt, confrontational responses from the manager who offered no willingness to help or resolve the matter - instead effectively arguing with me in a live chat exchange - to the extent where they were suggesting by offering me a sent date and time for the link they apparently sent me for the handover form (which I didn't receive), was proof that I had received and read the changeover form:\r\n",

      "\"I have given you the date and time. Send it to your mail service provider... And they can check the logs. That will be the proof\"\r\n",

So, instead of resending the form, or offering to process the exchange of ownership as previously requested, I was told to settle the account with the debt collectors, including interest incurred, because there was nothing else they could do (or were willing to do, despite having the ability to do so) \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I am incredulous to say the least. I have never experienced such poor, impersonal and unprofessional service from a service provider. For the record, during the exchange I mentioned to the manager (after giving several opportunities to put things right) that I would be sharing my experience on Trustpilot. He responded by saying that I would be \"defaming their name on unfounded grounds\". Well, I can assure you my experience is very real. \r\n",

The guides provided in the different cities will vary in personality and the accommodation will vary is style, to which you may have a personal preference, but that is to be expected.  Considering the driving conditions in India, we thought our driver was legendary!

However, the site did not say that orders would be sent ONCE VERIFIED BY PHONE and it took 2 days for me to actually talk to someone before the vouchers were sent.  Every time I called the number noted in the email, I rec'd a recording saying all representatives were busy and someone would call me back.  We played phone tag (as I was at work during the day and am not allowed personal calls) for 48 hours which delayed my delivery.   The gift cards were for a basket for Nurse's Week and we almost did not make the deadline---which we easily would have made if the vouchers had been sent as promised.  I still do not understand the \"verification\" process; they wanted my name, address and charge card---information that I had already provided.

      "My family and I truly enjoyed the Fat Tire Bike Tour of Paris.  We were a family of 8 adults and 3 children.  We all got the bikes we wanted, including my 7-year old grandson.  For our two 5-year old grandchildren who didn't know how to bike yet, a trailer was attached to one of the adult bikes and they too enjoyed the tour.  Our tour guide, Kirstie, was fantastic!  She had a lovely Scottish lilt and made the history of Paris come alive!  It felt like she was just relating a story that happened yesterday.  I learned so much more about  Paris, French history, they way Paris as a city was planned than I ever had during past trips.  And biking around made us feel like local Parisians.  Kirstie took good care in guiding us safely through the busy streets of Paris.  Everyone in my family thinks that the Bike tour was the best!\n",
